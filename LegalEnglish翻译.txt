Company law
公司法

Characteristics of a company
公司的特征

A company is regarded in law as being a separate legal ‘person’, with a separate legal personality. This means that it has rights separate from its owners and managers to enter into contracts, employ people, own property and conduct business. The creation and management of a company is governed by the Companies Act 1985 (CA’85) and the Companies Act 1989.
By far the largest number of incorporated companies are incorporated with limited liability, being limited by shares as defined by section 1(2)(a) CA ’85. The potential financial liability of a member (in other words shareholder) in such a company is limited to the amount, if any, remaining unpaid on the shares held by that particular member. Such a company is known as a limited company and will have the word ‘Limited’ at the end of its name.
A company can be a private or a public company. A public company must have a minimum issued share capital of £50,000, as required by sections 11 and 118 CA ’85. Apublic company may offer its shares for sale to the public (s. 81 CA’85), whereas a private company must not. A public company may also have its shares listed (and traded) on the Stock Exchange. Information on the current values of such listed shares is publicly available and can be checked for instance in The Financial Times.


在法律上，公司被视为具有独立法人资格的独立法“人”。这意味着它拥有独立于其所有者和经理签订合同、雇用人员、拥有财产和开展业务的权利。公司的创建和管理受《1985年公司法》（CA'85）和《1989年公司法》管辖。

到目前为止，注册成立的公司数量最多，受CA '85第1（2）（a）条定义的股份限制。成员（换句话说，股东）在此类公司中的潜在财务责任仅限于该特定成员持有的股份的未支付金额（如果有的话）。这样的公司被称为有限公司，其名称末尾将有“有限公司”一词。


公司可以是私人公司或上市公司。上市公司必须拥有 50，000 英镑的最低已发行股本，符合第 11 条和第 118 CA '85 条的要求。
上市公司可以向公众出售其股票（第81 CA'85条），而私人公司不得。上市公司也可以将其股票在联交所上市（和交易）。有关此类上市股票当前价值的信息是公开的，例如可以在《金融时报》上查看。


Exercise 1–reading

COMPANY FORMATION
There are a number of legal requirements which must be complied with in order to incorporate (in other words create) a company. In particular, the following documentation will normally be required.
Memorandum of Association
The Memorandum of Association (known as the ‘articles of incorporation’ in the US) contains the following information:
· Name of the company
· The company’s objects and powers (meaning basically the sphere of activities and nature of the company)
· The company’s share capital
Articles of Association
The Articles of Association (the articles) are in effect a set of rules governing the conduct of the members of the company and its officers. The officers of a company are its directors and company secretary. These rules commonly relate to matters such as the conduct of shareholder and board meetings, any restriction on the transferability of shares and the powers bestowed on the directors etc. (In the US the Articles of Association are known as the bylaws.) Many companies use a standard form of articles known as ‘Table A Articles’.

Form 10
This is a standard form which must be completed with details of the intended officers of the company, as required by s. 10(2) CA ’85. Every incorporated company must have at least one director and one company secretary. (If there is to be only one director then that individual cannot also be the company secretary.) Details of the company’s registered office (at which formal documents will usually be served upon the company) should also be included in Form 10.

Form 12
This is another standard form which must be signed by a person applying for incorporation of the company to certify that the legal requirements for registration have been complied with.
The person signing Form 12 (commonly known as the promoter of the company) can be one of the directors, the company secretary or a solicitor engaged in the formation of the company.
Once completed, these company documents must then be sent to the Registrar of Companies (‘the registrar’), along with a fee. The registrar then registers the company and issues a Certificate of Incorporation. This is when the company comes into existence. There are further legal requirements which the incorporated company must then continue to comply with, such as having annual accounts prepared (s. 226 CA ’85), a copy of which must be filed annually at Companies House (s. 242 CA ’85).

练习 1 - 阅读
公司成立
为了成立（换句话说，创建）公司，必须遵守许多法律要求。特别是，通常需要以下文件。
组织章程大纲
组织章程大纲（在美国称为“公司章程”）包含以下信息：
  ·公司名称
  ·公司的目标和权力（基本上是指公司的活动范围和性质）
  ·公司股本
公司章程
公司章程细则（章程细则）实际上是一套管理公司成员及其高级职员行为的规则。公司的高级职员是其董事和公司秘书。这些规则通常涉及股东和董事会会议的举行、对股份可转让性的任何限制以及授予董事的权力等事项。（在美国，公司章程被称为章程。许多公司使用称为“表 A 文章”的标准形式的文章。

表格 10
这是一份标准表格，必须按照 CA '85 第 10（2） 条的要求填写公司预期官员的详细信息。每家注册公司必须至少有一名董事和一名公司秘书。（如果只有一名董事，则该人不能同时担任公司秘书。公司注册办事处的详细信息（通常向公司送达正式文件）也应包含在表格10中。

表格 12
这是另一种标准表格，必须由申请成立公司的人签署，以证明已遵守注册的法律要求。
签署表格12的人（俗称公司的发起人）可以是董事之一、公司秘书或参与公司成立的律师。
完成后，这些公司文件必须连同费用一起发送给公司注册处（“注册处”）。然后，注册商注册公司并颁发公司注册证书。这是公司成立的时候。注册公司必须继续遵守其他法律要求，例如准备年度账目（s. 226 CA '85），其副本必须每年在公司大楼提交（s. 242 CA '85）。


Exercise 2–comprehension
Answer the following questions concerning company formation, based on the above information.
1. What is meant by ‘limited liability’?
2. What is the minimum amount of issued share capital which a public company must maintain?
3. List the four documents normally required in order to form a company.
4. If a client wishes to incorporate a company and be its only director, can s/he also be the company secretary? If not then explain why not.
5. Name the document issued by the Registrar of Companies which is in effect a ‘birth certificate’ for a new company.

练习 2 – 理解
根据上述信息，回答以下有关公司成立的问题。
1. 什么是“有限责任”？
2. 公众公司必须维持的最低已发行股本是多少？
3. 列出成立公司通常需要的四份文件。
4. 如果客户希望成立公司并担任其唯一董事，他/她也可以担任公司秘书吗？如果不可以，解释为什么不可。
5. 命名公司注册处签发的文件，该文件实际上是新公司的“出生证明”。

Exercise 3–drafting

Now assume that you are a lawyer in the Business Law Department of Stringwoods & Evans, a city law firm located at 18 Bond Street, London, W1 1KR (telephone number 020 7538 2892; DX number 12432, London 1). You have been instructed by a new client named Thomas Shapiro (TS) to incorporate a company for him. TS is a successful entrepreneur with business interests throughout Europe and the Far East. He now wishes to establish a private company limited by shares to be named ‘Maplink Limited’. Maplink Limited will be run as a business, publishing various maps and guides for tourists visiting London and other cities around the world.
Your senior partner has already drafted the Articles of Association for Maplink Limited. You are now required to complete the further documentation needed to form the company. This consists of:
· The Memorandum of Association
· Form 10
· Form 12
Taking account of the company details provided on p. 8, complete the following company formation documentation accordingly by entering the correct details in the shaded spaces.


练习 3 – 起草

现在假设您是Stringwoods & Evans商业法部门的律师，这是一家位于伦敦邦德街18号W1 1KR的城市律师事务所（电话号码020 7538 2892;DX 编号 12432，伦敦 1）。一位名叫托马斯·夏皮罗（TS）的新客户指示您为他成立一家公司。TS是一位成功的企业家，在整个欧洲和远东地区都有商业利益。他现在希望成立一家私人股份有限公司，名为“Maplink Limited”。Maplink Limited将作为一项业务运营，为访问伦敦和世界其他城市的游客发布各种地图和指南。
您的高级合伙人已经为Maplink Limited起草了组织章程。您现在需要完成组建公司所需的进一步文件。这包括：
·组织章程大纲

Grammar notes

Multi-word verbs
Multi-word verbs consist of a verb and at least one particle. A particle is a word which would be a preposition or an adverb in a different context. In this chapter you have encountered several examples of multi-word verbs such as those in: enter into a contract; comply with the requirements; subscribe their names to.
Multi-word verbs come in four categories:
1. verbs with particles and no object. E.g. Sit down!
2. verbs with two particles. E.g. He gets on with his client.
3. verb + inseperable particle ? object. E.g. I’m waiting for the trial.
4. verb + separable particle ? object. E.g. He set out the terms / He set the terms out.

多词动词由一个动词和至少一个助词组成。助词是一个词，在不同语境中可以用作介词或副词。在本章中，您已经遇到了几个多词动词的例子，例如：订立合同；遵守要求；签署他们的名字。
多词动词分为四类：
1. 带助词而无宾语的动词。例如坐下！
2. 带两个助词的动词。例如他和他的客户相处得很好。
3. 动词 + 不可分离助词 ? 宾语。例如我在等待审判。
4. 动词 + 可分离助词 ? 宾语。例如他制定了条款/他制定了条款。

Introduction
In this chapter and the next one we will consider the practice and procedure of company meetings. These take two basic forms:
1. Board meetings
2. Shareholders’ meetings
We shall consider shareholders’ meetings in the next chapter. The main characteristics of a board meeting (also known as a directors’ meeting) are as follows.

简介
在本章和下一章中，我们将探讨公司会议的实践和程序。这些会议有两种基本形式：
1. 董事会会议
2. 股东大会
我们将在下一章探讨股东大会。董事会会议（也称为董事会议）的主要特点如下。

Board meetings
Board meetings are attended by the directors of the company. Day to day business decisions are usually taken at board meetings. Matters to be decided upon are put to the meeting in the form of ‘resolutions’, each director present casting a vote for or against each resolution being considered. (Voting is usually by a ‘show of hands’.) Whether or not a resolution is passed depends on whether the majority of votes are in favour of or against that resolution. In other words the decision is made by a simple majority. Multi-national companies with directors located inter- nationally often stipulate in their articles that board meetings may be validly held by means of telephone or audio-visual conferencing as well as via the internet.

董事会会议
董事会会议由公司董事出席。日常业务决策通常在董事会会议上做出。待决定的事项以“决议”的形式提交会议，每位出席的董事对正在审议的每项决议投赞成或反对票。（投票通常采用“举手表决”的方式。）决议是否通过取决于多数票是赞成还是反对该决议。换句话说，决定由简单多数作出。董事位于国际各地的跨国公司通常会在其章程中规定，董事会会议可以通过电话或视听会议以及互联网有效举行。

Any director can call a board meeting on reasonable notice to all the other direc- tors. Board meetings are therefore often convened at short notice. A written record is made of matters discussed and of resolutions considered at a board meeting.
This record is known as the ‘minutes’ of the meeting.

任何董事均可在向所有其他董事发出合理通知后召集董事会会议。因此，董事会会议通常在短时间内召开。董事会会议讨论的事项和审议的决议均有书面记录。
该记录称为会议“会议记录”。

Exercise 1–comprehension
In Chapter 1 we incorporated a company named Maplink Limited (‘Maplink’). In common with all companies, Maplink will hold board and shareholders’ meetings. Let us assume therefore that Maplink is now planning to hold its first board meeting. (You may recall that Maplink has two directors, namely Thomas Shapiro and Dimitris Yavaprapas.) Continuing to act as Maplink’s lawyer you are now asked to prepare the minutes for the first board meeting of the company, taking account of the following specific instructions.

Grammar notes
Combining nouns
There are a number of instances in this chapter where two nouns are used together. In
such instances the first of the two nouns usually provides some indication or description
of the type or variety of the second noun. For example:
a directors’ meeting a shareholders’ meeting
(both a directors’ meeting and a shareholders’ meeting being types of meeting).
Further examples are: interview record (a type of record) Magistrates’ Court (a type
of court)
Sometimes when two nouns are placed together in this way they are separated by a
hyphen (-). This often occurs when the two nouns are commonly placed together, as
illustrated for instance with work-place and time-limit. If you are in any doubt as
to whether a hyphen is normally used with any particular combination of nouns you
are advised to use a good dictionary in order to check, such as Dictionary of Law by L.B. Curzon. Some combinations of nouns have become so synonymous with each other
however that they are written as one-word compound nouns. E.g. wheelchair.

语法说明
名词组合
本章中有许多两个名词一起使用的例子。在这种情况下，两个名词中的第一个通常会提供一些指示或描述第二个名词的类型或种类。例如：
董事会议 股东会议
（董事会议和股东会议都是会议的类型）。
其他示例包括： 面试记录（一种记录） 治安法庭（一种法庭）
有时，当两个名词以这种方式放在一起时，它们会用连字符 (-) 隔开。这通常发生在两个名词通常放在一起时，例如工作场所和时间限制。如果您对连字符是否通常与任何特定的名词组合一起使用有任何疑问，建议您使用一本好的字典来检查，例如 L.B. Curzon 的法律词典。然而，有些名词组合已经变得如此同义，以至于它们被写成单词复合名词。例如，轮椅。

Possessive forms
Possessive ‘s’
A possessive ‘s’ is added to nouns along with an apostrophe to indicate that the word(s) following are related (i.e. ‘belong’) to the word(s) with a possessive ‘s’. E.g. counsel’s opinion. The letter ‘s’ is also put at the end of nouns to indicate a range of other relation- ships. For example:

Places: Europe’s main legal centres
Time: four days’ trial

Plural nouns
When dealing with regular plural verbs the apostrophe ( ’ ) should be placed after the ‘s’.
You will see for instance that this is where the apostrophe is placed with:

directors’ meetings shareholders’ meetings
Note that the apostrophe is also placed after the possessive ‘s’ when a singular noun ends in ‘s’. For instance: James’s case.
With singular nouns however the apostrophe should be placed before the possessive ‘s’.
Hence:the expert’s report Gordon’s witness statement
This is also the correct position for the apostrophe with irregular plural nouns. E.g. women’s court attire.

所有格形式
所有格‘s’
所有格‘s’与撇号一起加到名词上，表示后面的单词与所有格‘s’的单词相关（即‘属于’）。例如，律师的意见。字母‘s’也放在名词的末尾，表示一系列其他关系。例如：

地点：欧洲主要法律中心
时间：四天审判

复数名词
处理常规复数动词时，撇号（’）应放在‘s’后面。

例如，您将看到撇号放在以下位置：

董事会议股东会议
请注意，当单数名词以‘s’结尾时，撇号也放在所有格‘s’后面。例如：詹姆斯的案子。
但是，对于单数名词，撇号应放在所有格“s”之前。
因此：专家报告 戈登的证人陈述
这也是不规则复数名词撇号的正确位置。例如，女士宫廷服装。

Introduction
You will recall that in the last chapter we identified two main types of company meetings:
1. Board meetings (also known as directors’ meetings)
2. Shareholders’ meetings (also known as members’ meetings)
In this chapter we will look at the practice and procedure of the second of these,having considered board meetings in the previous chapter. Read the next section on shareholders’ meetings then try the exercises which follow.

简介
您会记得，在上一章中，我们确定了两种主要的公司会议类型：
1. 董事会会议（也称为董事会议）
2. 股东会议（也称为成员会议）
在本章中，我们将研究第二种会议的实践和程序，并在上一章中讨论了董事会会议。阅读下一节关于股东会议的内容，然后尝试完成后面的练习。

Exercise 1–reading

SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETINGS
Company law dictates that certain business decisions concerning a company need shareholder approval. In particular, shareholders’ meetings are required when major changes to the company are being proposed. Proposals for such changes are put to a shareholders’ meeting in the form of resolutions. Shareholders’ meetings can be attended by the company’s direc- tors as well as by its shareholders. However, only shareholders have the right to vote. (It is possible to be a director without being a shareholder, unless a company’s articles of associa- tion provide otherwise.) A company’s annual general meeting (AGM) is a type of shareholders’ meeting. Other share- holders’ meetings are known as extraordinary general meetings (EGMs). Twenty-one days’ no- tice is normally required to be provided to the shareholders before an AGM can be validly held, 14 days’ notice being required for an EGM. A vote on a proposed resolution is usually taken ini- tially by ‘a show of hands’. In the course of such a vote each shareholder (otherwise known as a member of the company) normally has one vote, irrespective of the number of shares s/he possesses. Once the result of the vote on ‘a show of hands’ is declared, any member may de- mand what is known as a ‘poll’ (unless the company’s articles specifically provide otherwise).

If a poll is held votes are then counted differently. Rather than each member having one vote regardless of his or her shareholding, each member has one vote for each share s/he holds. The chairman of the company will usually have a casting vote in the event that the number of votes are the same for and against a resolution, in order to enable such a dead- lock to be broken. (Article 50 of Table A Articles provides for this for instance.) Shareholders’ meetings are usually called by the board. If however the board is reluctant to call a share- holders’ meeting then the shareholders can requisition one (as provided by s. 368 CA ’85).

练习 1——阅读

股东大会
公司法规定，公司某些业务决策需要股东批准。特别是，当公司提出重大变更时，需要召开股东大会。此类变更的提案以决议的形式提交股东大会。公司董事和股东均可出席股东大会。但是，只有股东才有投票权。（除非公司章程另有规定，董事可以不是股东。）公司的年度股东大会 (AGM) 是一种股东大会。其他股东大会称为特别股东大会 (EGM)。通常需要提前 21 天通知股东，才能有效召开年度股东大会，特别股东大会需要提前 14 天通知。对拟议决议的表决通常首先以“举手表决”的方式进行。在进行此类投票时，每位股东（也称为公司成员）通常都有一票，无论其持有多少股份。一旦“举手表决”表决结果公布，任何成员均可要求进行所谓的“投票表决”（除非公司章程另有明确规定）。

如果进行投票表决，则投票的计算方式将有所不同。与每位成员无论其持股多少都有一票不同，每位成员对其持有的每一股都有一票。如果赞成和反对某项决议的票数相同，公司董事长通常会投决定票，以便打破这种僵局。（例如，章程表 A 第 50 条对此作出了规定。）股东大会通常由董事会召集。但是，如果董事会不愿召集股东大会，股东可以要求召集（根据 1985 年《公司法》第 368 条的规定）。

TYPES OF RESOLUTIONS 
The types of resolutions and their main characteristics are set out below. The first two mentioned are the most common types of resolutions proposed at company meetings.

1. Ordinary Resolution (OR)–requires a simple bare majority (i.e. 50% +1 of votes cast) to be passed. Usual notice required to be provided to members of a proposed ordinary resolution is 14 days.
2. Special Resolution (SR)–requires 75% of votes cast. Usual notice requirement is 21 days.
(Note that this means therefore that if an SR is being proposed at an EGM then the required notice for the EGM will normally be 21 days rather than 14 days.)
3. Extraordinary Resolution–similar to a special resolution albeit notice requirement is 14 days (as opposed to 21 days for a special resolution).
4. Elective Resolution–enables private companies to ‘opt out’ of certain company law formalities by unanimous agreement (e.g. to dispense with need to hold an annual general meeting each year).
5. Written Resolution–a resolution in writing which can be validly passed without the need for a meeting provided all those entitled to vote sign the written resolution to signify their unanimous approval of the resolution.

决议类型
决议类型及其主要特征如下。前两种是公司会议上提出的最常见的决议类型。

1. 普通决议 (OR) – 需要简单多数票（即 50% +1 票）即可通过。通常需要向成员提供拟议普通决议的通知时间为 14 天。
2. 特别决议 (SR) – 需要 75% 的票数。通常的通知要求是 21 天。
（请注意，这意味着如果在 EGM 上提出 SR，则 EGM 所需的通知通常为 21 天，而不是 14 天。）
3. 特别决议 – 类似于特别决议，但通知要求为 14 天（而特别决议为 21 天）。
4. 选举决议——允许私营公司通过一致同意“选择退出”某些公司法手续（例如，无需每年召开年度股东大会）。
5. 书面决议——书面决议可以有效通过，无需召开会议，只要所有有权投票的人签署书面决议，表示他们一致批准该决议。
