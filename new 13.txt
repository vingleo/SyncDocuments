The great ship, Titanic, sailed for NewYork from Southampton on April 10th,
1912. She was carrying 1316 passengers and a crew of 89l. Even by modern
standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship. At that time, however, she
was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as
unsinkable, for she had sixteen water-tight compartments. Even if two of these
were flooded, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great
liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her first voyage with heavy
loss of life. 
Four days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a look-out. After the alarm had been given, the great  ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time,narrowly missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the
water beside her. Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from below, and
the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so faint
that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized
to his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen water-
tight compartments had already been flooded ! The order to abandon ship was
given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water. As there were not
enough life-boats for everybody, 1500 lives were lost.


Going through the Customs is a tiresome business. The strangest thing about it is
that really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The hardened professional
smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has
five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned from abroad
recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a
smuggler.
'Have you anything to declare?' he asked, looking me in the eye.
'No,' I answered confidently.
'Would you mind unlocking this suit-case please ?'
'NOt at all,' I answered.
The Officer went through the case with great care. All the things I had packed
so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to
close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light up. He had spotted
a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.
'Perfume, eh?' he asked sarcastically. 'You should have declared that.'
Perfume is not exempt from import duty.'
'But it isn't perfume,' I said.' It's hair-oil.' Then I added with a smile,' It's
a strange mixture I make myself.'
As I expected, he did not believe me.
'Try it!' I said encouragingly.
The Officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was
greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth.
A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk-marks on my
baggage.
