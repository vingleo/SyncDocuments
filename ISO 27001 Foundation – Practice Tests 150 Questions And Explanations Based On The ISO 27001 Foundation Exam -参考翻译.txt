D. 将某些信息资产的访问权限限制为特定群体

13. C
Explanation:
ISO 27001 sets out the requirements for an ISMS, which is a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information so as to keep it secure.
One of the key principles of an ISMS is that the organization regularly identifies and assesses the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information assets, and then puts controls in place to treat those risks. This is the most appropriate action for an organization to take in order to ensure the security of their information assets. While A, B, and D may also contribute to the security of information assets, they are not sufficient on their own and must be part of a comprehensive, risk-based approach.
解释：
ISO 27001 规定了信息安全管理体系 (ISMS) 的要求，ISMS 是一种管理公司敏感信息以确保其安全的系统性方法。
ISMS 的关键原则之一是，组织应定期识别和评估其信息资产的机密性、完整性和可用性风险，并实施控制措施来应对这些风险。这是组织为确保其信息资产安全而应采取的最适当的措施。虽然 A、B 和 D 也可能有助于保障信息资产的安全，但仅凭这些措施是不够的，必须将其纳入基于风险的综合方法中。

14. A company is in the process of implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO 27001.

Insurance and outsourcing are two common methods of risk transfer in ISO 27001. With insurance, an organization can purchase coverage to offset the costs of any losses incurred due to a security incident. Outsourcing involves transferring certain responsibilities and tasks to a third-party provider, which can help reduce the organization's risk by allowing them to focus on core tasks. Separation of duties and process redesign are also important for risk management, but they don't directly transfer risk to a third-party.

解释：
保险和外包是 ISO 27001 中两种常见的风险转移方法。通过保险，组织可以购买保障，以抵消因安全事件造成的任何损失。外包是指将某些职责和任务转移给第三方提供商，这可以帮助组织降低风险，使其能够专注于核心任务。职责分离和流程重新设计对于风险管理也很重要，但它们不会直接将风险转移给第三方。

A. 可用资源量
B. 组织的成本
C. 风险的潜在影响
D. 风险发生的概率

13. C, D
Explanation:
The ISO 27001 standard states that the risk is determined by taking into account both the potential impact of the risk and the probability of the risk occurring. The potential impact of the risk is the extent of the damage that could be caused by the risk. The probability of the risk occurring is the likelihood that the risk will occur. The amount of resources available and the cost to the organization are not factors used to determine risk according to ISO 27001.

解释：
ISO 27001 标准规定，确定风险时需同时考虑风险的潜在影响和风险发生的概率。风险的潜在影响是指风险可能造成的损害程度。风险发生的概率是指风险发生的可能性。根据 ISO 27001 标准，可用资源量和组织成本并非用于确定风险的因素。
