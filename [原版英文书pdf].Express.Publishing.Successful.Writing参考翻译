Describe a person you know well
When I began working at Hillcrest Nursery School three years ago, I was introduced to Sharon Dunn, the school's headmistress.
Her smart appearance and warm, friendly expression made me like her immediately. She is a small-boned,smiling woman in her early fifties,with twinkling blue eyesand soft,silver curls. Although she dresses simply she always manages to look elegant.She is a very fair-minded person who treats everyone at the school with equal respect.Despile clasping her hands nervously when she is upset,she is actually very calm, whichis shown by her ability to keep her temper in the most difficult situations. Her quiet voiceand gentle, caring manner make her popular with the children.
Ms Dunn has no children of her own; however,she says that she feels like a motherto all of the children in her school. In fact, she has no time for family life,since she ded-icates her life to her job.Besides taking care of various administrative tasks every day,she always takes time to talk to the teachers and parents. In addition,she often holdsmeetings with the school's Board of Directors,as well as with staff and parents.
To my mind, Sharon Dunn is a dedicated professional who is a wonderful role model,not only for the children but for the teachers,as well.

描述一个你熟悉的人
三年前，当我开始在 Hillcrest 幼儿园工作时，有人向我介绍了学校的女校长 Sharon Dunn。
她聪明的外表和热情友好的表情让我立刻喜欢上了她。她是一个身材娇小、笑容可掬的 50 岁出头的女人，有着闪闪发光的蓝眼睛和柔软的银色卷发。虽然她穿着简单，但她总是显得优雅。她是一个非常公正的人，对学校里的每个人都一视同仁。当她心烦意乱时，Despile 会紧张地紧握双手，但她实际上非常冷静，这从她在最困难的情况下控制脾气的能力中可以看出来。她平静的声音和温柔、关怀的态度使她深受孩子们的欢迎。
Dunn 女士自己没有孩子；然而，她说她觉得自己就像学校里所有孩子的母亲。事实上，她没有时间陪伴家人，因为她把一生都奉献给了工作。除了每天处理各种行政事务外，她总是抽出时间与老师和家长交谈。此外，她还经常与学校董事会以及教职员工和家长开会。
在我看来，莎伦·邓恩是一位敬业的专业人士，她是一位出色的榜样，不仅对孩子如此，对老师也是如此。
