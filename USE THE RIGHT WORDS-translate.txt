4.1 Absorb
These words, all relatively formal, indicate the taking in of one thing by another. Absorb is slightly more informal than the others and has, perhaps, the widest range of uses. In its most restricted sense, it suggests the taking in or soaking up specifically of liquids: the ink absorbed by the blotter. In more general uses, it may imply the thoroughness of the action: not merely to read the chapter, but to absorb its meaning. Or it may stress the complete disappearance of the thing taken in within the encompassing medium: once-lovely countryside absorbed by urban sprawl. Ingest refers literally to the action of taking into the mouth, as food or drugs, for later absorption by the body. Figuratively it designates any taking in, and suggests the receptivity necessary for such a process: too tired to ingest even one more idea from the complicated philosophical essay he was reading. To digest is to alter food chemically in the digestive tract so that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream. In other uses, digest is like absorb in tressing thoroughness, but is even more emphatic. [You may completely absorb a stirring play in one evening, but you will be months digesting it.]

这些词都比较正式，表示一种东西被另一种东西吸收。吸收比其他词更不正式，而且用途可能最广泛。在最狭义的意义上，它指的是吸收或吸收液体：吸墨纸吸收的墨水。在更一般的用法中，它可能意味着行动的彻底性：不仅仅是阅读章节，还要吸收其含义。或者它可能强调被吸收的东西在周围介质中的完全消失：曾经美丽的乡村被城市扩张所吸收。摄取的字面意思是将食物或药物放入口中，以便身体随后吸收。从比喻上讲，它表示任何吸收，并表明这种过程所必需的接受能力：太累了，甚至无法再吸收他正在阅读的复杂哲学论文中的一个想法。消化就是在消化道中对食物进行化学改变，使其能够被吸收到血液中。在其他用法中，digest 类似于吸收，但更加强调。[你可能在一个晚上就完全吸收一部激动人心的戏剧，但你需要几个月的时间才能消化它。]

Assimilate is even more emphatic about the thoroughness of the taking in than either absorb or digest ?in both its specific physiological and general uses. Physiologically, food is first digested, then absorbed by the bloodstream, and then assimilated bit by bit in each cell the blood passes. In more general uses, assimilate, unlike previous words, often implies a third agent beside the absorber and the absorbed ?an agent that directs this process: the architect who assimilates his building to its environment. The process, furthermore, often implies the complete transformation of the absorbed into the absorbing medium. Assimilate also suggests a much slower process than digest and certainly than absorb, which can be nearly instantaneous: It would take the city generations to assimilate the newcomers into the patterns of a strange life.

无论是在生理学还是在一般用法中，“同化”都比“吸收”或“消化”更强调吸收的彻底性。从生理学上讲，食物首先被消化，然后被血液吸收，然后在血液经过的每个细胞中一点一点地被同化。在更一般的用法中，与前面的词不同，“同化”通常意味着除了吸收者和被吸收者之外还有第三个媒介——指导这一过程的媒介：将建筑与环境同化的建筑师。此外，这一过程通常意味着被吸收者完全转化为吸收介质。同化还表明了一个比消化和吸收更慢的过程，几乎是瞬间完成的：城市需要几代人的时间才能将新来者同化到陌生的生活模式中。

Incorporate is the only word here that does not have a specific use pertaining to the taking in of liquids or of food, meaning literally "to embody." It compares to that aspect of assimilate which stresses the loss of separate identity for the absorbed quantity: incorporating your proposals into a new system that will satisfy everyone. It is unlike assimilate in lacking that word’s suggestion of necessarily careful, time-consuming thoroughness.

结合是这里唯一没有特定用法的词，与摄入液体或食物有关，字面意思是“体现”。它与同化相比，强调吸收量失去独立身份：将您的建议纳入一个让每个人都满意的新系统。它与同化不同，缺乏同化所暗示的必然谨慎、耗时的彻底性。

Imbibe, while capable of uses comparable to those for assimilate, is mainly rooted still to its specific use for the taking in of liquids. Even this use, and certainly any others, now sound slightly archaic and excessively formal: Do you imbibe alcoholic beverages?

Imbibe 的用法虽然与 assimilate 的用法相似，但主要还是指液体的摄入。即使是这种用法，当然还有其他用法，现在听起来也有点过时和过于正式：你喝酒精饮料吗？

4.2 Abstain
Abstain means to withhold oneself from an action or elf-indulgence. [There were six votes in favour, two against and two abstaining; He abstained from drinking.] Refrain has to do with withholding an action temporarily, or checking a momentary desire: She refrained from scolding her child until the company left. To forbear, in its intransitive sense, is to exercise self-control, often out of motives of patience or charity. [Though impatient, the customer forbore to upbraid the harried salesgirl; The teacher forbore to report Johnnie’s misbehaviour to his parents.]

禁欲意味着克制自己不做某件事或放纵自己。[有六票赞成，两票反对，两票弃权；他戒酒。] 禁欲与暂时克制某件事或抑制一时的欲望有关：她克制自己不责骂孩子，直到客人离开。忍耐，在不及物动词的意义上，是锻炼自我控制，通常是出于耐心或慈善的动机。[虽然不耐烦，但顾客忍住了责备这位烦躁的女售货员；老师忍住了不向约翰尼的父母报告他的不当行为。]

4.3 Absurd
Absurd means opposed to reason or truth, and may be applied to that which is grossly, and sometimes grotesquely, inconsistent with common sense or experience. Preposterous denotes a great contrariness to nature, reason, or common sense, and is used to describe that which is outrageously absurd. Ridiculous refers to that which is absurd in a way that invites ridicule or mockery. [It is absurd to predict that the sun will not rise tomorrow; it is preposterous that virtue should go unrewarded while vice goes unpunished; It is ridiculous to judge a foreign culture by its plumbing.]

荒谬意味着与理性或真理相悖，可以用于描述与常识或经验严重、有时甚至荒谬地不一致的事情。荒谬表示与自然、理性或常识相悖，用于描述极其荒谬的事情。可笑是指荒谬到引人嘲笑或嘲弄的事情。[预测明天太阳不会升起是荒谬的；美德得不到奖励而恶行不受惩罚是荒谬的；通过管道来判断外国文化是荒谬的。]

Farcical and ludicrous are applied to that which is absurd in an amusing way. Farcical indicates a humorous distortion of fact, convention or reason. Ludicrous implies playful absurdity, but may also be synonymous with ridiculous in describing something that is greeted with scorn or derision. [The farcical introduction of a talking horse gave the play its flavour; The ludicrous antics of the harlequins delighted the audience; The speaker made a series of ludicrous mistakes which were rewarded with hoots and catcalls.]

Farcical 和 ludicrous 用来形容以有趣的方式表现出荒诞的事物。Farcical 表示对事实、惯例或理由的幽默扭曲。Ludicrous 暗示着玩笑式的荒诞，但在描述受到蔑视或嘲笑的事物时，也可能与 ridiculous 同义。[一匹会说话的马的滑稽介绍为这出戏增添了情趣；小丑的滑稽动作让观众很开心；演讲者犯了一系列可笑的错误，结果引来了嘘声和嘘声。]

Foolish, senseless and silly add a suggestion of folly or even of a trivial intellect to their synonymity with absurd. [To buy shares in an unlisted wild-cat enterprise is a foolish investment; To beat a dead horse is senseless; To make unsupportable claims is silly affectation.]

愚蠢、无意义和愚蠢除了与荒谬同义外，还增加了愚蠢甚至微不足道的智力。[购买未上市的野猫企业的股票是愚蠢的投资；鞭打死马是毫无意义的；提出无法证实的主张是愚蠢的矫揉造作。]

Unreasonable and irrational mean contrary to reason, the difference between them being the fact that unreasonable implies a bias or intent to go wrong and irrational suggests an uncontrollable lack of understanding. [It is unreasonable to maintain a geocentric theory of the universe; It is irrational to expect an adult reaction from a child.]

不合理和非理性意味着违背理性，它们之间的区别在于，不合理意味着偏见或故意犯错，而非理性则意味着无法控制的缺乏理解。[坚持地心说是不合理的；期待孩子做出成年人的反应是不合理的。]

	ANTONYMS: consistent, logical, rational, reasonable, sagacious, SENSIBLE.
	
	

4.4 Accompany
Accompany and attend are alike in meaning to go with, but each suggests a different relationship between persons. We accompany our equals, and attend those to whom we would show courtesy or to whom we are subordinate. When they refer to things, accompany and attend mean to be present with as a result of. [A sense of accomplishment often accompanies hard effort; A feeling of depression attends many illnesses.]
	
陪伴和出席的含义相同，都是陪伴，但两者所指的人际关系不同。我们陪伴同辈，并照顾那些我们会礼貌相待或下属的人。当它们指代事物时，陪伴和出席的意思是作为结果而出现。[努力往往伴随着成就感；许多疾病伴随着沮丧感。]

Escort and convoy are closely related, but escort is the broader term. To convoy means to accompany ships or vehicles for protection, while to escort is to go with them, or with persons, either for the purpose of guarding or as a mark of courtesy. Militarily, a land movement is escorted, a sea movement convoyed. During World War II, merchant ships were convoyed across the Pacific by the Navy. A troop march may be escorted by armed vehicles. As a mark of courtesy, a ship making its maiden voyage is escorted by other craft in or out of the harbour. A boy is expected to escort his date to the door.

护送和护航密切相关，但护送是更广泛的术语。护航意味着陪同船只或车辆进行保护，而护送则意味着与船只或人员一起前往，以保护或作为礼节。军事上，陆地运输需要护送，海上运输需要护送。二战期间，商船由海军护送穿越太平洋。军队行军可能由武装车辆护送。作为礼节，首航的船只由其他船只护送进出港口。男孩应该护送他的约会对象到门口。

Chaperon means to accompany, but carries the implication of guidance or supervision in the interests of protection or propriety. A young girl may be chaperoned by her aunt while travelling abroad; a sportsmaster may be asked to chaperon a basketball dance.

Chaperon 的意思是陪伴，但也有出于保护或礼节的指导或监督的含义。年轻女孩出国旅行时可能会由她的姨妈陪伴；体育指导员可能会被要求陪伴参加篮球舞会。

Conduct, like chaperon, suggests guidance as part of accompanying,
but here the interest is merely to physically lead: Let’s hire a guide to
conduct us through the old section of the city.

行为，就像陪同者一样，暗示着作为陪伴的一部分的指导，
但这里的兴趣仅仅是身体上的引导：让我们雇一个导游，
带我们​​穿过城市的老城区。

	ANTONYMS: LEAVE.
	

4.5 Accomplice
Accomplice and confederate both denote a person who is associated with another in the perpetration of a crime, whether that association is limited to the planning stages or is extended to the entire execution of the wrongdoing. Thus, an accomplice or confederate may, but need not necessarily, be present at the scene of the crime. [The role of the murderer’s accomplice was that of weapon procurer; Although Fredericks planned the theft, it was one of his confederates who actually entered the house and stole the jewels.]

共犯和同谋均指与他人共同实施犯罪的人，无论这种关联仅限于计划阶段，还是扩展到整个犯罪的实施阶段。因此，共犯或同谋可以（但不一定）出现在犯罪现场。[凶手的同谋的角色是武器采购者；虽然弗雷德里克斯策划了盗窃，但真正进入房屋并偷走珠宝的是他的同谋之一。]

An abettor is an accomplice or confederate who is present and who participates in the execution of a crime. A look-out is an abettor in a bank robbery.

教唆犯是指在场并参与实施犯罪的共犯或同谋。 监视者是指银行抢劫案中的教唆者。

Accessory is the legal term for an accomplice who helps a felon without being present at the scene of the crime. If he helps the felon’s preparations, he is an accessory before the fact; if he helps the felon to escape punishment once the crime has been committed, he is an accessory after the fact.

从犯是法律术语，指在犯罪现场之外帮助重罪犯的共犯。如果他帮助重罪犯准备犯罪，则为事前从犯；如果他帮助重罪犯在犯罪后逃避惩罚，则为事后从犯。

Conspirator and plotter refer to persons who are involved in a secret or underhanded agreement to do some evil act. Conspirators are those who take part in a conspiracy, which is a legal term denoting an intention to violate the law by a group of people acting in concert; in general use, it is applied to major crimes and even more particularly to treason. Plotters are implicated in an activity which has a sinister purpose, but which, even though it is difficult to plan and execute, may be petty in scope.

共谋者和策划者是指参与秘密或暗中协议实施某些邪恶行为的人。共谋者是指参与阴谋的人，阴谋是一个法律术语，表示一群人共同行动，意图违反法律；一般来说，它适用于重大犯罪，甚至更具体地说是叛国罪。策划者参与了一项具有险恶目的的活动，但尽管计划和执行起来很困难，但范围可能很小。

4.6 Accumulate
Accumulate and amass both mean to pile up by successive addition. To accumulate is to heap or pile up or bring together by degrees or by regular additions; to amass is to bring together a great quantity and usually suggests great value. A housewife may accumulate gift tokens; a speculator may try to amass great wealth; an army may amass armaments for a final push. Collect and gather are interchangeable in the sense of bringing together into one place or into a group. Collect suggests discriminating selection in a way that gather does not: to collect stamps as a hobby but with the idea of reselling them later at a profit; to gather a large bunch of wildflowers along a country road. Hoard means to gather and store for the sake of accumulation. It always connotes a selfish desire to keep permanently or for future use and suggests secrecy in the process. [A miser hoards his money; In wartime, individuals may hoard scarce items.]

积累和聚集都表示通过连续增加而堆积起来。积累是逐渐或定期增加而堆积或聚集在一起；聚集是聚集大量，通常表示巨大的价值。家庭主妇可能会积累礼券；投机者可能会试图积累巨额财富；军队可能会聚集军备以备最后冲刺。收集和聚集在聚集到一个地方或一群人的意义上可以互换。收集意味着有选择性的选择，而聚集则没有：收集邮票作为一种爱好，但想着以后转售以赚取利润；在乡间小路上采集一大束野花。囤积意味着为了积累而收集和储存。它总是暗示一种自私的愿望，想要永久保存或以备将来使用，并暗示在此过程中保密。[守财奴囤积他的钱财；在战争时期，个人可能会囤积稀缺物品。]

ANTONYMS: disperse, dissipate, scatter, spend, squander, waste.


4.7 Acumulation
All these words, as here considered, mean a mass of things that come or are brought together. They all imply that the things are neither merged with one another nor united organically in the resultant mass. Accumulation means that the things have come together by a series of additions rather than all at once. It often implies that the things are of the same kind, such as the accumulation of dust on surfaces, or of money in banks, and does not imply any coherence or organization in the mass gathered.

所有这些词，正如这里所考虑的，都表示聚集在一起的大量事物。它们都意味着这些事物既没有相互融合，也没有在最终的物质中有机地结合在一起。积累意味着这些事物是通过一系列的添加而不是一次性地聚集在一起的。它通常意味着这些事物属于同一类，例如表面上积聚的灰尘或银行里的钱，并不表示聚集的物质具有任何连贯性或组织性。

Collection and accumulation are often used interchangeably, but collection frequently implies a high degree of selection and organization in the mass collected: An accumulation of many specimens is needed when one is preparing a scientific collection. Aggregation always denotes a mass brought together that forms, in some sense, a coherent whole, but one that has a lesser degree of organization than dose a collection: An industrial empire is often an aggregation of unrelated enterprises. Conglomeration implies that many different and sometimes even incongruous things are brought together from widely scattered sources or regions: The population of New York City is a conglomeration of many different kinds of people from various countries.

收集和积累经常互换使用，但收集通常意味着在收集的大量样本中进行高度的选择和组织：准备科学收集时，需要积累许多样本。聚集总是表示聚集在一起的大量样本在某种意义上形成一个连贯的整体，但其组织程度低于收集：工业帝国通常是无关联企业的集合。集团意味着许多不同甚至不协调的东西从分散的来源或地区聚集在一起：纽约市的人口是来自不同国家的许多不同类型的人的聚集。

4.8 Accurate
Accurate, exact, precise and true, as here considered, agree in implying close conformity to an objective standard. Accurate suggests that there are degrees of conformity to such a standard and stresses the painstaking care necessary for the attainment of fidelity to truth or  fact: It took a week of investigation to get an even reasonably accurate account of the accident. Exact emphasizes extreme accuracy in measurable quantities and qualities: The exact wave length assigned to a transmitting station must always be maintained. Precise stresses great accuracy with regard to minute details: The assembling of the parts of a watch must be precise. True, as here considered, implies absolute accuracy, particularly in reproductions of an original: a true copy of a birth certificate.

收集和积累经常互换使用，但收集通常意味着在收集的大量样本中进行高度的选择和组织：准备科学收集时，需要积累许多样本。聚集总是表示聚集在一起的大量样本在某种意义上形成一个连贯的整体，但其组织程度低于收集：工业帝国通常是无关联企业的集合。集团意味着许多不同甚至不协调的东西从分散的来源或地区聚集在一起：纽约市的人口是来自不同国家的许多不同类型的人的聚集。

Correct suggests the absence of error or fault and conformity to some standard. It is more general than the other words in this group because it applies to such things as taste and fashion as well as to truth or fact: the correct dress for a formal dinner. Right is largely interchangeable with correct, but often adds a hint of moral approval: the right course of action.

比该组中的其他词更普遍，因为它既适用于品味和时尚，也适用于真相或事实：正式晚宴的正确着装。Right 在很大程度上可以与 Correct 互换，但通常会增加一点道德认可：正确的行动方针。

Nice, in this sense, meaning a high or even an inordinate degree of precision or exactness, is passing out of usage, but it is still encountered in formal writing.

“Nice”在这个意义上指的是高度甚至过度的精确度或准确性，这种用法已经不再使用，但在正式写作中仍然可以遇到。

4.9 Accuse
These words all mean to declare a person to be guilty of some offence or shortcoming. Accuse is the most general word, and may be used in formal or informal, official or personal, contexts. An investigating committee may accuse an officeholder of wrongdoing; a neighbour may accuse a man of playing his radio too loudly.	
	
这些词都表示宣告某人犯有某种罪行或缺点。 指控是最常用的词，可用于正式或非正式、官方或个人场合。 调查委员会可能会指控公职人员犯有不法行为；邻居可能会指控某人将收音机开得太大声。

Charge, in this context, means to accuse formally, usually before a court; by extension, it means to accuse informally of a violation of some accepted standard. [The police charged the driver with reckless driving; The candidate charged his opponent with evasion of the basic issues.]	

指控，在此语境中，是指正式指控，通常在法庭上；延伸而言，是指非正式地指控违反某些公认标准的行为。[警方指控司机鲁莽驾驶；候选人指控对手回避基本问题。]

Incriminate means to charge a person with a crime directly, or to involve him in a crime by damaging testimony. In popular use, the latter is the more usual meaning: He was incriminated by an eyewitness who placed him at the scene of the crime.

指控某人有罪的意思是直接指控某人有罪，或通过破坏性证词将某人牵扯进犯罪。在通俗用法中，后者是更常见的意思：他被目击者指控，目击者将他放在犯罪现场。

Indict and arraign are legal terms. Indict, which is more commonly used in the United States than elsewhere, means to charge officially and to make subject to an appearance before a jury or judge. In an extended sense, indict is to charge unofficially but publicly: to indict a school of writing or painting as being obscurantist. To arraign, legally, is to call an indicted person before a court for trial; by extension, to arraign is to call publicly but unofficially a person or a movement to stand judgement before public opinion or some other standard.

起诉和控告都是法律术语。起诉在美国比在其他地方使用得更普遍，意思是正式指控并让被告出庭接受陪审团或法官审判。从广义上讲，起诉是非正式但公开的指控：指控某个写作或绘画流派是蒙昧主义。从法律上讲，控告是将被起诉的人传唤到法庭接受审判；从广义上讲，控告是公开但非正式地传唤某个人或某个运动接受公众舆论或其他标准的审判。

Technically, impeach means to arraign a person ?usually a public official ?before a competent tribunal on a charge of treason or other  high crime. In Britain, where the process takes the form of prosecution by the House of Commons before the House of Lords, the lastimpeachment occurred in 1806, when Lord Melville was acquitted of malversation of public funds while treasurer of the navy.

从技术上讲，弹劾是指将某人（通常是公职人员）以叛国罪或其他重罪指控送交主管法庭。在英国，弹劾程序由下议院在上议院进行起诉，上一次弹劾发生在 1806 年，当时梅尔维尔勋爵在担任海军财务主管期间因挪用公款罪被宣告无罪。

In extended use, to impeach is to discredit or to call into question: to impeach a witness; to impeach a person’s motives.

在扩展用法中，弹劾是指诋毁或质疑：弹劾证人；弹劾某人的动机。

4.10 Acknowledge
These words agree in meaning to accept openly, though with some reluctance, the truth or existence of a fact, condition, etc. One acknowledges something embarrassing or awkward, and usually not voluntarily; more often, the acknowledgement is extracted from one more or less unwillingly: The general acknowledged that the war had not been going as well as expected, but he affirmed that a change instrategy would enhance the prospects of victory.
	
这些词的含义一致，虽然有些不情愿，但公开接受事实、情况等的真实性或存在性。一个人承认一些令人尴尬或尴尬的事情，通常不是自愿的；更常见的是，这种承认是或多或少不情愿的：将军承认战争的进展并不像预期的那样顺利，但他肯定改变战略将增加胜利的可能性。

Admit is a bold acknowledgement of implication in something one has formerly tended to deny or to equivocate about: He admitted under questioning that he was in the service of a foreign power, but denied that he was guilty of espionage. One concedes, usually because of overwhelming evidence, something which he has been very reluctant to admit. [He had no choice but to concede that he had been guilty of bad judgement; In the face of the disastrous military battle, they conceded that victory was no longer attainable, and agreed to a negotiated surrender.] Confess is to admit guilt, as to a crime, or to admit to a shortcoming: to confess that he was an accomplice in the robbery; He confessed that he had never read Lady Chatterley’s Lover.

Admit 是对以前倾向于否认或含糊其辞的事情大胆地承认其牵连：在审讯下，他承认自己为外国服务，但否认自己犯有间谍罪。人们通常因为确凿的证据而承认自己一直不愿承认的事情。[他别无选择，只能承认自己判断失误；面对灾难性的军事战斗，他们承认胜利已无望，同意通过谈判投降。] Confess 是承认有罪，如承认罪行或承认缺点：承认他是抢劫案的同谋；他承认自己从未读过《查泰莱夫人的情人》。

4.11 Act
An act, in the sense considered here, is something that is done. The act may be done by a person, a group or an impersonal entity, and is not limited by motive, nature or result. Thus, an act of God is a violent outbreak of nature; the act of a maniac may endanger the community; the act of a philanthropist may enrich it. While act refers to something that is accomplished, action refers to the accomplishing of it or the process by which it is accomplished: the action of acid on metal.

在这里所考虑的意义上，行为是指已经完成的事情。行为可以由一个人、一个团体或一个非个人实体完成，不受动机、性质或结果的限制。因此，天灾是自然界的剧烈爆发；疯子的行为可能危及社区；慈善家的行为可能使社区富裕。行为指的是已经完成的事情，而行动指的是完成它或完成它的过程：酸对金属的作用。

Deed, while sometimes used to connote any act, good or bad, big or small, is usually synonymous with exploit and feat in meaning an achievement of great courage, nobility, intelligence, strength or skill. An exploit is often a physical act; discovering a continent, scaling a high mountain, rocketing to a distant planet, and descending to the ocean floor are all exploits. A feat may also be a physical act, but it applies to mental acts as well. [Formulating the General Theory of Relativity was a prodigious mental feat; Playing several chess games simultaneously while blindfolded is a remarkable and impressive feat.] A deed is generally an act that is noteworthy for its difficulty or nobility. [The labours of Hercules were deeds of courage and ingenuity; A good deed may range from endowing a university to helping an old lady cross the street.]

功绩有时用来表示任何行为，无论好坏，大小，但通常与功绩和壮举同义，意为勇气、高尚、智慧、力量或技能的成就。功绩通常是一种体力行为；发现大陆、攀登高山、飞向遥远的星球和潜入海底都是功绩。壮举也可能是一种体力行为，但它也适用于精神行为。[提出广义相对论是一项了不起的精神壮举；蒙着眼睛同时下几盘棋是一项了不起的壮举。] 功绩通常是一种因其难度或高尚而值得注意的行为。[赫拉克勒斯的劳作是勇气和智慧的体现；善举可能包括从捐赠一所大学到帮助一位老太太过马路。]

Operation and performance in this context can be synonymous with  act or action, but are usually considered to be combinations of acts or the manner in which they are carried out. A military operation is a series of co-ordinated individual and group acts; the performance of an employee is the manner in which he carries out the acts that are part of his job’s routine.

此处的“操作”和“绩效”可以与“行为”或“行动”同义，但通常被认为是行为的组合或行为的执行方式。军事行动是一系列协调的个人和团体行为；员工的绩效是其执行日常工作行为的方式。

4.12 Activity
Activity means the state of being in motion, or the expenditure of energy. Activity is a broad word, applicable to physical or mental exertions or pursuits by a person or a group, and is often used to convey the idea of a number of separate simultaneous or successive operations: the activity of the heart; a busy week filled with social activities.
 
活动是指运动状态或能量消耗。活动是一个宽泛的词，适用于个人或群体的体力或脑力活动或追求，通常用于表达一系列独立同时或连续的操作：心脏的活动；充满社交活动的忙碌一周。

Bustle, commotion, stir and to-do all mean a feverish, noisy or excited activity by either an individual or a group. Bustle suggests busyness, activity with a purpose: the bustle on the floor of the Stock Exchange. Commotion suggests excitement and noisy disorganization: the commotion in a schoolroom during the teacher’s absence. Stir suggests excited movement or discussion: the stir aroused in the audience by the speaker’s remarks. To-do hints at unnecessary or uncalled-for excitement: the to-do generated by the new secretary coming to work in slacks and flatties.

Bustle、commotion、stir 和 to-do 都表示个人或团体的狂热、嘈杂或激动的活动。Bustle 表示忙碌，有目的的活动：证券交易所大厅的喧嚣。Commotion 表示兴奋和嘈杂混乱：老师不在时教室里的骚动。Stir 表示激动的动作或讨论：演讲者的言论在观众中引起的骚动。To-do 暗示不必要或不必要的兴奋：新秘书穿着长裤和平底鞋上班引起的骚动。

4.13 Acumen
These words all refer to a highly developed mental ability to see or understand what is not obvious. Acumen has to do with keenness of intellect, and implies an uncommon quickness and discrimination of mind. It requires acumen to solve an intricate problem in human
relationships, or to emerge unscathed from a venture into the stock market.

这些词都指高度发达的智力，能够发现或理解不明显的事物。敏锐与智力的敏锐有关，意味着思维的敏捷性和辨别力。它需要敏锐来解决人际关系中复杂的问题，或者在股市冒险中毫发无损地脱颖而出。

Insight and perception mean the power to recognize the hidden springs of behaviour or the true nature or cause of a situation or condition: A psychiatrist’s insight into human behaviour may uncover the underlying cause of a boy’s delinquency; a doctor’s perception may recognize a patient’s complaints as symptoms of a psychic disorder. Perception in its basic sense applies to anything recognized or understood by the senses, and in its extended sense to anything recognized or understood by the mind, thus suggesting a likeness between mind and the senses. Perception therefore suggests a view of the mind as a keenly receptive but none the less passive instrument, sensitive to very slight stimuli. Insight, on the other hand, is consistent with a view of the mind as an active agent, seeking and sifting ideas and probabilities as well as the evidence of sensations. In most contexts insight implies a more profound use of intellect and wisdom than does perception; insight suggests a knowledge of the inner character or essence of a thing, whereas perception relies primarily on the sharpness or acuity of one’s senses.

洞察力和感知力意味着识别行为的隐藏动机或情况或条件的真正性质或原因的能力：精神科医生对人类行为的洞察力可以揭示男孩犯罪的根本原因；医生的感知力可以识别出患者的投诉是精神障碍的症状。感知力的基本意义适用于任何被感官识别或理解的事物，其引申意义适用于任何被心灵识别或理解的事物，从而表明心灵和感官之间的相似性。因此，感知力表明心灵是一种敏锐的接受能力但同样被动的工具，对非常轻微的刺激都很敏感。另一方面，洞察力与将心灵视为主动主体的观点一致，它寻找和筛选想法和概率以及感觉的证据。在大多数情况下，洞察力比感知力意味着更深层次地运用智力和智慧；洞察力表明对事物内在特征或本质的了解，而感知主要依赖于人的感官的敏锐度或敏锐度。

Acuity means sharpness or keenness, and is applied exclusively to perception: visual acuity; The intelligence test was used as a basis for judging his mental acuity.

Acuity 的意思是敏锐度或敏锐度，专门用于感知：视觉敏锐度；智力测试被用作判断他的智力敏锐度的基础。

4.14 Adapt
Adapt and adjust mean to change someone or something to suit new circumstances or a different environment. Adapt involves considerable change to meet new requirements, while adjust implies a minor change, as in the alignment of parts: to adapt a novel for the stage; to adjust a motor; to adjust the differences between two parties in a dispute. Adapt emphasizes the purpose for which the change must be made: The shred politician adapts his speech to suit the interests of his audience. Adjust is also used to mean to adapt oneself to a changed environment: Astronauts in flight must adjust to weightlessness.
	
适应和调整的意思是改变某人或某物以适应新的情况或不同的环境。适应涉及为满足新要求而进行的重大改变，而调整则意味着微小的改变，例如零件的排列：将小说改编为舞台剧；调整发动机；调整争议中双方的分歧。适应强调了必须进行改变的目的：精明的政治家调整他的演讲以适应听众的兴趣。调整也用于表示使自己适应变化的环境：飞行中的宇航员必须适应失重状态。

Conform, as here considered, means to correspond to a model or pattern: The building must conform to the plans and specifications. In a commonly used extended sense, conform means to adhere or adjust to conventional behaviour: When travelling in a foreign country, it is wise to conform to the habits of the natives. This last example may also be recast reflexively: to conform oneself to the habits of the natives. To fit something is to adapt it to a purpose or use: A prudent man fits his standard of living to his budget.

此处所指的“符合”是指与模型或模式相符：建筑物必须符合规划和规格。在常用的扩展意义上，“符合”是指遵守或适应传统行为：在国外旅行时，最好遵循当地人的习惯。最后一个例子也可以反身改写：使自己符合当地人的习惯。适合某物是指使其适应某种目的或用途：一个谨慎的人会根据自己的预算调整自己的生活水平。

Accommodate and reconcile are similar to adapt in meaning to change something or oneself in acknowledgement of an external condition. [A European visitor to the Far East must accommodate himself to habits of life that may seem very strange to him; A man  following a military career must reconcile himself to long absences from his family.] Reconcile implies an accommodation not without misgivings or resentment; one reconciles oneself to certain conditions because the alternatives are even less palatable. Accommodate, on the other hand, conveys no such connotation, but suggests that the adjustment will make one’s own lot easier because it will gratify others.

Accommodate 和 reconcile 与 adapt 意思相似，意思是改变某物或自己以适应外部条件。[一位欧洲游客到远东必须适应对他来说可能非常奇怪的生活习惯；一位从事军事生涯的人必须适应与家人长期分离。] Reconcile 意味着一种不无疑虑或怨恨的适应；一个人适应某些条件，因为其他选择更难以接受。另一方面，Accommodate 并没有传达这样的内涵，而是暗示这种调整将使自己的命运更容易，因为它将使其他人感到满意。

4.15 Adaptable
These words suggest the ease with which something will respond to an external force without breaking. Adaptable is the most general and most abstract, suggesting the favourable quality of an ingenious or practical ability to alter habit as a response to changed circumstances: The ice ages exterminated many less adaptable species. Yielding is nearly as abstract as adaptable but more readily suggests an unfavourable passivity or unassertiveness than a favourable ability to improvise responses to challenges: the familiar stereotype that makes out all women as helpless and yielding.
	
这些词语表示某物能够轻易地应对外力而不会破裂。适应性是最普遍和最抽象的，表示具有巧妙或实用的能力，能够改变习惯以应对变化的环境：冰河时代消灭了许多适应性较差的物种。屈服几乎与适应性一样抽象，但更容易暗示不利的被动性或不自信，而不是有利的即兴应对挑战的能力：熟悉的刻板印象使所有女性都无助和屈服。

Flexible and elastic have concrete applications to physical objects in which case they suggest something with spring to it or something that will quickly resume its shape after being distorted. Elastic suggests stretching, as of a band or membrane; flexible suggest bending, as of a rod or tube. Adjustable is applied to objects that can be manually altered to suit different uses or purposes: An adjustable car seat slides backwards or forwards to accommodate the driver.

柔性和弹性在物理对象方面有具体应用，在这种情况下，它们表示具有弹性的东西或变形后能迅速恢复形状的东西。弹性表示拉伸，如带或膜；柔性表示弯曲，如杆或管。可调适用于可以手动改变以适应不同用途或目的的物体：可调式汽车座椅可向后或向前滑动以适应驾驶员。

Used in the sense of adaptable, elastic suggests the ability to recover quickly in the face of a threat or upset: a man who was amazingly elastic and imperturbable under pressure. Elastic can also refer to a projected set of requirements, rules, or figures, when they are open to revision in the light of experience: an elastic budget that allows for unexpected outlays for new equipment; elastic, sensible rules drawn up by the students themselves. Flexible, in this context, is closer in meaning to adaptable than any other word here. It does not necessarily suggest a permanent adjustment to change but rather momentary shifts of position to maintain balance: a society so flexible in the face of new influences as to lack unity or purpose. As in this example, flexible may suggest low standards or a chameleonic nature, whereas adaptable can suggest a slow, hard-won process of decisive movement in a new direction.

elastic 用于表示适应性时，指面对威胁或不安时迅速恢复的能力：一个在压力下表现出惊人弹性和沉着冷静的人。Elastic 还可以指一组预计的要求、规则或数字，当它们可以根据经验进行修改时：允许意外支出购买新设备的弹性预算；学生自己制定的弹性、合理的规则。在这种情况下，flexible 的意思比这里的任何其他词都更接近 adaptable。它并不一定表示永久地调整以适应变化，而是表示瞬间的位置转移以保持平衡：一个社会在面对新影响时过于灵活，以至于缺乏团结或目标。如在本例中，flexible 可能表示低标准或变色龙般的性质，而 adaptable 可能表示朝着新方向决定性前进的缓慢、来之不易的过程。

4.16 Add
Add, the most general word in this group, means to join or unite so as to increase the importance, size, quantity or scope of something: to add a new line of merchandise to one’s goods; to add a new wing to a building; to add five new salesmen to a staff; to add a touch of levity to an otherwise solemn speed.

Add 是该组中最常用的词，意思是连接或联合以增加某事物的重要性、大小、数量或范围：在自己的商品中添加新的商品系列；在建筑物中增加新的侧楼；在员工队伍中增加五名新的销售员；在严肃的气氛中添加一点轻松的气氛。

Attach, as here considered, means to connect or join on as a part, and is close in some contexts to append: to attach a stipulation to a contract; to append a query to a manuscript. Append emphasizes that the addition is subordinate or minor in relation to the original work. Both words are formal, but attach has a legalistic ring to it lacking in append: to attach a rider to a bill; to append a footnote. Note that add could be used in place of wither of these words, but would make the tone less formal and therefore less impressive.

此处的 Attach 表示连接或加入为一部分，在某些情况下与 append 相近：将条款附加到合同中；将查询附加到手稿中。Append 强调添加的内容相对于原始作品而言是从属或次要的。这两个词都是正式的，但 attachment 具有法律意义，而 append 则缺乏：将附加条款附加到法案中；附加脚注。请注意，add 可以代替这些词中的 wither，但会使语气不那么正式，因此不那么令人印象深刻。

Affix means to fix or attach to: to affix a seal to a document. Affix is appropriate only in very formal contexts, as in the description of state affairs: The Govenor-General affixed his signature to the bill regulating assisted immigration.

Affix 的意思是固定或附着：在文件上加盖印章。Affix 只适用于非常正式的语境，例如在描述国家事务时：总督在协助移民管理法案上签了名。

Annex means to add something as a supplement. It implies not only that the addition is a subordinate part, but often that the addition remains distinct: to annex an adjoining territory; to annex a building to an older one.

Annex 的意思是添加某物作为补充。它不仅意味着添加的部分是从属部分，而且通常还意味着添加的部分保持独立：吞并相邻的领土；将建筑物并入旧建筑物。

4.17 Addition
These words all refer to parts of a while, either integral or incidental. Addition and supplement share one sense in which the part and whole being joined are alike in kind, so that only an increase in quantity results. [The new members will be a welcome addition to the club; A vitamin supplement is not necessary for the average diet.] Both words have uses, on the other hand, in which the part remains distinguishable from and subordinate to the whole. [What a charming ddition the sunroom makes to your house; The paper-covered book of quizzes was a supplement to the class’s mathematics textbook.] A supplement can also be a standard or special section of a newspaper: the Sunday supplement on the autumn fashions. Appendix, like supplement, can refer to a part of a book, but is more often bound with the book itself. Neither of these are essential to the book’s completeness, although both would offer additional details on given material.

这些词全都指一段时间的各个部分，要么是整体的，要么是偶然的。Addition 和 supplement 有一个共同的意义，即部分和整体结合在一起时在种类上是相同的，因此只会导致数量的增加。[新成员将受到俱乐部的欢迎；维生素补充剂对于普通饮食来说不是必需的。] 另一方面，这两个词也有其用途，即部分与整体保持可区分且从属于整体。[日光室给你的房子增添了多么迷人的色彩；这本平装的测验书是班级数学教科书的补充。] supplement 也可以是报纸的标准或特别栏目：关于秋季时装的周日增刊。附录和 supplement 一样，可以指书的一部分，但通常与书本身装订在一起。这两者都不是书的完整性所必需的，尽管两者都会提供有关给定材料的额外细节。

Appendage refers to a more integral part of a whole than do any of the other terms. It is especially used in the life sciences to indicate the limbs or extremities of a plant or animal. No one except such a scientist, however, is likely ?even in the most formal of contexts ?to use appendage in preference to limb, branch, arm, leg, tail or whatever. Biologists themselves, in fact, can be every bit as exact and certainly more succinct in speaking of a monkey’s tail rather than its caudal appendage. In other uses of this word, the subordination of the part to the whole is emphasized. Such uses may be rather stiff except when a note of mockery is conveyed. [It was apparent to everyone that the husband had become a mere appendage to his wealthy wife.]

附属物比其他任何术语都更能指代整体的组成部分。它特别用于生命科学，表示植物或动物的肢体或末端。然而，除了这样的科学家，没有人可能——即使在最正式的语境中——使用附属物而不是肢体、分支、手臂、腿、尾巴或其他任何东西。事实上，生物学家自己在谈论猴子的尾巴而不是它的尾部附属物时，也可以完全准确，而且肯定更简洁。这个词的其他用法强调了部分对整体的从属关系。除非传达出一种嘲讽的语气，否则这种用法可能相当生硬。[每个人都清楚，丈夫已经成为他富有的妻子的附属物。]

Appurtenance and adjunct both refer to a part that becomes a valuable addition to a whole, though not essential to it. Appurtenance has a specific legal sense of an incidental property right that goes together with a major right, such as the right of way to a building. The sense of a gratuitous advantage pervades its other meanings as well: He was unusual in considering her beauty as an appurtenance to her vigorous mind, and not vice versa. In adjunct, the separateness of the added part is stressed: Memorization is only an adjunct to real education, not its whole.

附属物和附属物都指成为整体的宝贵补充，但并非整体的必要部分。附属物具有特定的法律意义，指与主要权利（如建筑物的通行权）相伴的附带财产权。无偿优势的含义也渗透到了其他含义中：他不同寻常地认为她的美貌是她活跃头脑的附属物，而不是相反。在附属物中，强调了附加部分的独立性：记忆只是真实教育的附属物，而不是其全部。

Attachment and accessory refer to parts that are neither essential to nor fused with the whole they complement. An attachment increases the usability of the original whole for which it is specifically designed, although its use is optional: If we had a flash-bulb attachment we could also take pictures at night. One meaning of accessory is identical with that of attachment, as in car accessories. Another sense of accessory points to its enhancing of the beauty, rather than the usefulness of the whole to which it is added: the tastefully chosen accessories that dramatize the simplest dress or suit.

附件和配件是指既不是整体的必需品也不是整体的融合部分。附件增加了其专门设计的原始整体的可用性，尽管其使用是可选的：如果我们有一个闪光灯附件，我们也可以在夜间拍照。配件的一个含义与附件相同，例如汽车配件。配件的另一个含义是指它增强了整体的美感，而不是实用性：精心挑选的配饰使最简单的连衣裙或西装变得引人注目。

4.18 Adequate
These words mean equal to what is required or expected, but not exceeding it by much. Adequate means suitable to the case or occasion: an adequate supply of food for the hike. Like satisfactory, adequate may apply to quality as well as quantity: an adequate performance, but nothing to rave about; His knowledge of French was adequate for the job, although he was not fluent in the language. Satisfactory implies a standard to which something is being compared or against which it is being tested. [The child’s reading ability was satisfactory for his age level; The response to our call for financial contributions was wholly satisfactory, exceeding our goal by several thousand dollars.]

这些词的意思是等于所要求或所期望的，但不会超出太多。足够的意思是适合情况或场合：徒步旅行所需的足够食物。和令人满意一样，足够也适用于质量和数量：表现不错，但没有什么值得称赞的；他的法语知识足以胜任这份工作，尽管他并不流利。令人满意意味着将某物与之进行比较或测试的标准。[这个孩子的阅读能力与他的年龄水平相符；我们呼吁捐款的回应完全令人满意，超出了我们的目标几千美元。]

Enough is in some contexts interchangeable with adequate, but is used only to indicate amount or degree, not quality. Moreover, unlike adequate, enough is not used after an article and before a noun in this sense. One can say an adequate fuel but not an enough fuel. (Note that adequate fuel can mean either enough fuel or fuel of acceptably high quality, whereas an adequate fuel can refer only to quality.) Enough modifies either plural nouns or nouns denoting something that is measurable or of which there can be a quantity: enough salesmen; enough time; enough air ?but not: enough supply; enough house.

在某些情况下，enough 可以与 adequate 互换，但仅用于表示数量或程度，而不是质量。此外，与 adequate 不同，enough 不能用在冠词后和名词前。人们可以说 an adequate fuel，但不能说 an enough fuel。（请注意，a adequate fuel 可以表示足够的燃料或质量可接受的燃料，而 an adequate fuel 只能指质量。）enough 可以修饰复数名词或表示可测量或有数量的东西的名词：enough salesmen；enough time；enough air ?但不能：enough supply；enough house。

Sufficient implies a quantity or number adequate for a particular need  or to fulfil a particular purpose: Our military response to the aggressive act was limited but sufficient to show our determination. Unlike satisfactory, it does not imply measuring up to a standard. It emphasizes instead the end being sought; the degree to which something contributes to the achievement of that end is what makes it sufficient or insufficient.

足够意味着数量或数目足以满足特定需要或实现特定目的：我们对侵略行为的军事反应有限，但足以表明我们的决心。与令人满意不同，它并不意味着达到标准。相反，它强调所追求的目标；某物对实现该目标的贡献程度决定了它是足够还是不足。

4.19 Advice
Advice and counsel mean an opinion or a judgement given by one person to another urging him either to do something or not to do it. Advice, the more general term, may be given on serious matter or relatively trivial ones, but counsel suggests solemn advice given in an official or authoritative capacity about a matter of some importance, at least to the person seeking it: to give advice to one’s son on the choice of a career; a woman seeking advice on hair styling; a young resident who profited from the counsel of an experienced surgeon. Advice, unless qualified by an adjective suggesting otherwise, often implies that the adviser has a direct and more or less personal interest in the person advised; the subject of advice is thus often personal in nature. Counsel, on the other hand, suggests a detached, impersonal view on the part of the person giving it; and the subject of counsel is often of a business nature.

建议和忠告是指一个人向另一个人提出的意见或判断，敦促他做某事或不做某事。建议是更笼统的术语，可以针对严肃的事情或相对琐碎的事情提出，但忠告则指以官方或权威身份就某件重要的事情给出的严肃建议，至少对寻求建议的人来说是这样：为儿子的职业选择提供建议；女性寻求发型设计方面的建议；年轻的住院医生从经验丰富的外科医生的建议中受益。除非用形容词修饰，建议通常意味着建议者对被建议的人有直接的、或多或少的个人利益；因此建议的主题往往是个人性质的。另一方面，忠告则表明提供建议的人采取一种超然的、不带个人色彩的观点；忠告的主题往往是商业性质的。

Recommendation, in this sense, suggests advice given on the basis of one’s own experience, and expresses a stronger, more positive endorsement of a particular course than advice. One’s advice may be to choose the lesser of two evils; a recommendation implies that one course is distinctly favourable and ought to be purused on its own merits: to read a new book on the recommendation of a friend.

从这个意义上讲，推荐是指根据个人经验给出的建议，比建议更强烈、更积极地支持某一特定课程。一个人的建议可能是两害相权取其轻；而推荐则意味着一种课程明显有利，应该根据其自身优点来选择：根据朋友的推荐阅读一本新书。

4.20 Afraid
Afraid means showing fear. When used by itself, no particular degree of fear is indicated. [She’s afraid of dogs, even of puppies; We are afraid to walk in the park at night since the woman was killed there.] In most uses, being afraid is personal, and the fear has to do with bodily harm. Afraid is also used in polite discourse to indicate nothing more than mild concern: I’m afraid I’m a bit late for my appointment. Sometimes this use conceals great fear: If our present policy is continued, I am afraid that war is inevitable.

害怕意味着表现出恐惧。单独使用时，并不表示特别程度的恐惧。[她害怕狗，甚至害怕小狗；我们害怕晚上在公园散步，因为那个女人在那里被杀了。] 在大多数用法中，害怕是个人的，并且恐惧与身体伤害有关。害怕也用于礼貌的话语中，仅表示轻微的担忧：恐怕我有点迟到了。有时这种用法隐藏着巨大的恐惧：如果我们目前的政策继续下去，恐怕战争不可避免。

Frightened and scared often suggest fear of bodily harm, but not invariably; both may be used to describe vague fears of unknown source. [When the lights went out I got scared; She’s always frightened when she’s alone in the house.] Frightened has a more genteel sound than scared, but both apply strictly to physical felt fear, even if the causes are emotional or imaginary.

Frightened 和 scary 经常表示害怕身体受到伤害，但并非总是如此；两者都可用于描述来源不明的模糊恐惧。[当灯熄灭时，我感到害怕；当她独自在家时，她总是感到害怕。] Frightened 听起来比 scary 更文雅，但两者都严格适用于身体感受到的恐惧，即使原因是情绪或想象的。

Anxious means tense and worried. Fearful may mean full of terror or dread, but often means merely apprehensive ?that is, anticipating danger, failure or trouble. In the latter sense, fearful shares with anxious the suggestion that the worry stems from inner concern without much relevance to external conditions, and is in this sense unreasonable. Apprehensive suggests awareness of impending danger caused by circumstances, and does not depend so much on one’s peculiar nature or habitual state of mind. [She was anxious about her daughter being out so late at night; The playwright was fearful that his irst opening would be a failure; an investor who was apprehensive about his holdings during the recession; We are frankly fearful of another depression unless the economy improves radically in the next few months.]

焦虑意味着紧张和担忧。恐惧可能意味着充满恐惧或害怕，但通常仅意味着忧虑——即预期危险、失败或麻烦。在后一种意义上，恐惧与焦虑一样，都暗示担忧源自内心的担忧，与外部条件没有太大关系，从这个意义上讲，恐惧是不合理的。忧虑意味着意识到由环境引起的迫在眉睫的危险，而不太取决于一个人的特殊天性或习惯性心理状态。[她担心女儿晚上这么晚还不在家；剧作家担心他的第一次开演会失败；一位投资者在经济衰退期间对自己的持股感到忧虑；坦率地说，除非经济在未来几个月内出现根本性好转，否则我们担心会出现另一场经济衰退。]

Aghast, alarmed and terror-stricken are applied to strong feelings of fear or fright. Aghast means afraid or frightened to the point of shock. A man waking up in a burning house will be aghast at the thought that his family may be in grave danger. Alarmed means suddenly and sharply afraid or frightened. Parents will be alarmed by a sudden outbreak of polio in their community. Terror-stricken is the strongest word in this list, and suggests fear to strong that normal reactions are suppressed. A terror-stricken person who is drowning may in panic resist the efforts of someone who is trying to save him.

Aghast、alarmed 和 terror-stricken 用来形容强烈的恐惧或惊吓。Aghast 表示害怕或惊吓到震惊的程度。一个人在着火的房子里醒来，想到他的家人可能处于严重危险之中，他会惊慌失措。Alarmed 表示突然而剧烈地害怕或惊吓。父母会因社区突然爆发脊髓灰质炎而感到惊慌。Terror-stricken 是这个列表中最强烈的词，表示害怕太强烈，以至于正常的反应都被抑制了。溺水的惊恐症患者可能会惊慌失措地抵抗试图救他的人的努力。

4.21 Aggression
All these words refer to actions initiated against other persons or groups, especially in wars. Aggression means unprovoked belligerent action, as by one nation upon the territory of another. An attack is aimed at injuring or destroying others, often by catching them off guard and unprepared. An assault is a violent attack, so violent that it often implies personal abuse motivated by envy, malice and the like. Both attack and assault can be applied to any violent conflict, verbal as well as physical: a personal assault on the character of the chairman; a vigorous attack on the fiscal policy of the present government. [We will continue to resist aggression because tyranny must be resisted; The attack came just before dawn; The final assaults were designed to clear the last remnants of enemy resistance.] Aggression, as the above example illustrates, is now widely used among diplomats to describe a variety of actions contrary or hostile to the interests of their own countries; aggression is thus a linguistic casualty of the cold war, and has lost much of its meaning. Assault suggests ?perhaps more than attack ?the element of suddenness and surprise, as evidenced by the expression "surprise attack"; such emphasis is unnecessary with assault. In psychoanalytic usage aggression is a tendency towards hostile action. This sense has led to a number of analogous popular usages: He’s just taking out his aggressions on me!

所有这些词都指针对其他人或团体发起的行动，尤其是在战争中。侵略是指无端的交战行为，如一个国家对另一个国家的领土发动的战争。攻击的目的是伤害或摧毁他人，通常是在他们措手不及和没有准备的情况下发动的。袭击是一种暴力袭击，其暴力程度往往意味着出于嫉妒、恶意等动机的人身攻击。攻击和袭击都可以用于任何暴力冲突，无论是口头的还是身体的：对主席人格的人身攻击；对现任政府财政政策的猛烈攻击。[我们将继续抵抗侵略，因为必须抵抗暴政；袭击发生在黎明前；最后的袭击是为了清除敌人最后的抵抗残余。]正如上面的例子所示，侵略现在被外交官广泛用来描述各种违背或敌视本国利益的行为；因此，侵略是冷战的语言牺牲品，已经失去了其大部分含义。攻击可能比攻击更具有突然性和出其不意的成分，正如“突袭”这一表达所表明的那样；攻击不需要如此强调。在精神分析用法中，攻击是一种采取敌对行动的倾向。这种含义导致了许多类似的流行用法：他只是在向我发泄他的攻击性！

An offensive is a movement or position of offence or attack. In some contexts it is interchangeable with attack, but in others it applies to a large-scale co-ordinated military campaign of men and matériel: a major new offensive was launched in the western front. In recent diplomatic language, offensive is sometimes used synonymously with initiative: a peace offensive in the form of a three-point offer to negotiate an end to the war.

进攻是进攻或攻击的行动或位置。在某些情况下，进攻与攻击可以互换，但在其他情况下，进攻适用于大规模协调的军事行动，包括人员和物资：在西线发动了一场新的重大攻势。在最近的外交用语中，进攻有时与主动权同义：以三点提议的形式进行和平攻势，以谈判结束战争。

4.22 Alcoholic
These words refer to a person who habitually drinks alcoholic beverages to excess. Alcoholic and drunkard are the most general of these, the first being the more formal and neutral of the two: Drunkard carries a tone of condemnation and can apply justly only to someone who frequently drinks past the point of sobriety: Anyone can see he’s a common drunkard the way he staggers home night after night. Alcoholic was at one time simply a medical description for someone who could not moderated his intake after the first drink. It has since become so popular as a general term that it appears often in informal contexts as well. Even informally the word lacks the tone of disapproval implicit in drunkard. It should be noted, however, that an alcoholic, unlike a drunkard, may have abstained from alcohol completely for years: He used to be a drunkard, but now he refuses drinks at parties by saying , "Sorry, but I’m an alcoholic."

这些词指的是习惯性地过量饮酒的人。Alcoholic 和 drunkard 是最常用的词，前者是两者中较为正式和中性的： Drunkard 带有谴责的语气，只能公正地适用于经常饮酒过度的人：任何人都可以从他夜复一夜地蹒跚回家的样子看出他是个普通的醉鬼。Alcoholic 曾经只是一种医学描述，指的是在第一次饮酒后无法控制饮酒量的人。此后，它成为一个非常流行的通用术语，也经常出现在非正式语境中。即使在非正式情况下，这个词也没有 drunkard 中隐含的不赞同语气。然而，应该注意的是，与 drunkard 不同，alcoholic 可能已经完全戒酒多年：他曾经是个酒鬼，但现在他在聚会上拒绝喝酒，说“对不起，但我是个酒鬼。”

Inebriate and dipsomaniac are technical terms to describe an excessive drinker, but alcoholic has so widely displaced them that both terms now seem antiquated or fusty. An inebriate, strictly speaking, is a person who is intoxicated at the moment of being described. Dipsomaniac , once the word for a chronic alcoholic (one whose steady intake does not disrupt his living patterns), now might be primarily jocose.

醉酒者 (inebriate) 和嗜酒狂 (dipsomaniac) 是描述酗酒者的专业术语，但酗酒者 (alcoholic) 已经广泛取代了这两个术语，以至于这两个术语现在似乎已经过时或过时了。严格地说，醉酒者是指被描述时处于醉酒状态的人。嗜酒狂 (dipsomaniac) 曾经用来形容慢性酗酒者（稳定饮酒不会打乱其生活规律的人），现在可能主要是开玩笑。

The rest of these words are either extremely informal or slang. A boozer might denote an acute alcoholic, one who alternates between periods of sobriety and intoxication in a pattern disruptive of his normal life. On the other hand, boozer can be used almost admiringly to describe a person who drinks a great deal without losing control of himself. [He was the most unbelievable boozer I ever saw; he could down six straight whiskies and never bat an eye.]

其余的词要么非常不正式，要么是俚语。boozer 可能表示一个严重的酒鬼，他经常在清醒和醉酒之间交替，这种模式扰乱了他的正常生活。另一方面，boozer 几乎可以用来形容一个喝了很多酒却没有失去自我控制的人。[他是我见过的最不可思议的酒鬼；他可以一口气喝下六杯威士忌，眼睛都不眨。]

Drunk is, of course, a shortening of drunkard, having greater informality than the latter and a tone of even greater contempt. A sot is one who is drunk most of the time, as is a soak.

Drunk 当然是 drunkard 的缩写，比后者更加不正式，语气也更加轻蔑。sot 指的是大部分时间都喝醉的人，suck 也一样。

Tippler and wino both refer to specific kinds of drinkers. A tippler drinks small amounts at frequent intervals over long periods of time. The word is often used for the secret or private drinker: No one would have guessed that the headmistress was a tippler except the man who carried away the empty bottles. Wino is usually applied to a tramp or derelict whose addiction to alcohol is satisfied by drinking inexpensive fortified wines. It is also used for any heavy drinker whose intake is primarily of wine.

Tippler 和 wino 都指特定类型的饮酒者。Tippler 会在很长一段时间内频繁地少量饮酒。这个词通常用于指秘密或私下的饮酒者：除了那个带走空酒瓶的人之外，没有人会猜到女校长是个酒鬼。Wino 通常用于指流浪汉或无业游民，他们的酒瘾通过喝廉价的加强葡萄酒来满足。它也用于指任何以葡萄酒为主的重度饮酒者。

ANTONYMS: abstainer, non-drinker, teetotaller.


4.23 Allegiance
Allegiance refers to the obligation of faithfulness, i.e., of fidelity, that a citizen owes his country or his sovereign in return for the benefits and privileges he receives by virtue of his citizenship. Allegiance is now widely used to refer to any similar obligation a person feels, as to a principle or a political leader. [In the Declaration of Independence, the American colonists renounced their allegiance to the British Crown; a lasting allegiance to this political party.] Fealty is used specifically of the feudal obligation a vassal owed his lord. The oath of fealty expressed both allegiance and fidelity.

效忠是指忠诚的义务，即忠实，公民应向国家或君主履行义务，以换取公民身份所获得的利益和特权。效忠现在被广泛用于指代一个人对原则或政治领袖的任何类似义务。[在《独立宣言》中，美国殖民者放弃了对英国王室的效忠；对这个政党的永久效忠。]效忠专门用于指封建封建义务，封建义务是附庸对领主的义务。效忠誓言既表达了效忠，也表达了忠诚。

Fidelity implies a strong and faithful dedication; His fidelity to the principles of justice never wavered. Loyalty is more often associated with personal relationships than is fidelity. Where fidelity suggests adherence, loyalty points to devotion. It emphasizes a profoundly
personal commitment. [His judgement was frequently faulty, but his loyalty to the nation could not be questioned; Company loyalty made him turn down many attractive job offers.]

忠诚意味着坚定而忠实的奉献精神；他对正义原则的忠诚从未动摇。忠诚与个人关系的关系比忠诚更密切。忠诚意味着坚持，忠诚则意味着奉献。它强调的是深刻的个人承诺。[他的判断经常出错，但他对国家的忠诚是毋庸置疑的；对公司的忠诚使他拒绝了许多诱人的工作机会。]

	ANTONYMS: disaffection, disloyalty, rebellion, sedition, treachery, treason.


4.24 Allegory
These words all denote a story told about fictional persons and events to teach or illustrate a moral principle. In an allegory or parable the moral is not stated, but is left to the hearer to discover. An allegory is usually long and elaborate, with many characters and incidents; a parable is brief, and typically shows the application of a moral precept to a familiar situation. A fable usually states the moral at the end, and is told in terms of animals that speak and reflect the nature of human beings. [Dante’s Divine Comedy is an allegory based on the struggle between the city-states of what is now Italy; The fable of the tortoise and the hare drives home the moral that steady, persistent application is more rewarding in the end than arrogant, unstable brilliance; The parables of the New Testament make abstract moral principles concrete and vivid.]

这些词都表示用虚构的人物和事件讲述的故事，用来教导或说明道德原则。寓言或比喻中没有陈述道德，而是留给听者去发现。寓言通常很长很复杂，有很多人物和事件；比喻简短，通常展示道德戒律在熟悉情况下的应用。寓言通常在最后陈述道德，用动物来讲述，动物会说话并反映人类的本性。[但丁的《神曲》是一个寓言，基于现在意大利城邦之间的斗争；龟兔赛跑的寓言告诉我们，坚持不懈的实践最终比傲慢、不稳定的才华更有回报；新约的寓言使抽象的道德原则变得具体而生动。]

4.25 Aloof
These words are comparable when applied to persons who are, or seem to be, emotionally distant from others. Aloof is applied to persons who are distant in manner or interest, as from a reluctance to associate with those whom they regard as intellectual or social inferiors, or because of habitual shyness or idiosyncrasy. [She held herself aloof from society, preferring to spend her days and nights dwelling on her memories; She always affected a grand, aloof manner with us poor middle-class people who work for a living.] Detached means free from emotional or intellectual involvement, and often suggests the neutral attitude of the impartial observer: the doctor’s detached approach to pain. Detached may also mean inwardly distracted, emotionally untouchable. [He always seems so detached about everything; you just can’t reach him at all.] Reserved implies  reluctance to express one’s feelings or thoughts. Where reserved emphasizes manner, detached stresses attitude. Both reserved and detached can be associated with attractive qualities, whereas aloof is seldom so considered. [He was a diffident, scholarly fellow with a reserved but genial manner; He looked about him with a very detached air, and announced to no one in particular that he was about to be sick.]

这些词用来形容感情上与他人疏远或似乎疏远他人的人时，是可以比较的。冷漠用来形容态度或兴趣疏远的人，比如不愿与他们认为智力或社会地位比他们低下的人交往，或者因为习惯性害羞或怪癖。[她远离社会，宁愿日夜沉溺于回忆中；对我们这些为生计而工作的贫穷中产阶级，她总是装出一副高高在上、冷漠无情的样子。] 疏离的意思是没有情感或智力的参与，常常暗示公正观察者的中立态度：医生对疼痛的冷漠态度。疏离也可能意味着内心心不在焉，感情上无法触及。[他似乎对一切都很冷漠；你根本联系不上他。] 矜持意味着不愿表达自己的感受或想法。矜持强调态度，而疏离则强调态度。矜持和超脱都与吸引人的品质有关，而冷漠却很少被认为具有吸引力。[他是一个谦逊的学者，举止矜持但和蔼可亲；他以一种非常超脱的神态环顾四周，没有向任何人宣布他即将生病。]

4.26 Amateur
These words are applied to a person who has some knowledge or proficiency in a certain area, but who is not an expert. Amateur usually means a person who pursues an interest, study or skill as a hobby or avocation rather than as a profession. Thus, a doctor who plays the violin in his spare time is an amateur in music, even if his playing is skilful. However, the word is sometimes used disparagingly to stress that a person’s skill, being non-professional, is not as good as it could be. If a man can’t fix a leaky tap, his wife may chide him by saying, "Oh well, you’re just an amateur!"

这些词适用于在某一领域具有一定知识或熟练程度但不是专家的人。业余爱好者通常指将兴趣、学习或技能作为业余爱好或业余爱好而不是职业的人。因此，业余时间拉小提琴的医生是音乐业余爱好者，即使他的演奏技巧娴熟。然而，这个词有时被用来贬义，强调一个人的技能不够专业，不够好。如果一个男人不会修漏水的水龙头，他的妻子可能会责备他说：“哦，你只是个业余爱好者！”

Dilettante means literally taking delight in and was originally applied to a person who was a lover of the arts. The word has in recent years, however, come to be associated with frivolousness and shallowness. A dilettante is a person who, though he shows interest in a field of knowledge or in an artistic skill, pursues it chiefly for enjoyment or ostentation, thus never attaining more than a superficial knowledge of it.

Dilettante 的字面意思是乐在其中，最初是指热爱艺术的人。然而，近年来，这个词却与轻浮和肤浅联系在一起。Dilettante 指的是这样的人，尽管他对某个知识领域或艺术技能表现出兴趣，但主要是为了享受或炫耀而追求它，因此对它了解的只是肤浅的知识。

Dabbler is an even more disparaging term than dilettante and denotes a person who merely dips into something without serious intent or perseverance.

Dabbler 是一个比 dilettante 更具贬义的术语，指的是仅仅涉猎某件事而没有认真意图或毅力的人。

4.27 Ambassador
These words all denote a diplomatic representative of a head of state or of a government. An ambassador is a diplomatic officer of the highest rank, appointed as the representative of one government to another. An ambassador extraordinary is one sent on a special mission, as distinguished from one, called an ambassador ordinary, who resides permanently in the country to which he is assigned.

这些词都表示国家元首或政府首脑的外交代表。大使是最高级别的外交官员，被任命为一个政府派往另一个政府的代表。特命大使是被派去执行特殊使命的大使，与常驻其被派往的国家的大使不同。

A minister is a diplomatic representative of lower rank than an ambassador. A minister sent on a special mission is called an envoy. Nuncio and legate are diplomatic representative of the Holy See, or Vatican State. A nuncio is an accredited ambassador of the Pope in a foreign country; a legate is a papal envoy, i.e. a diplomatic representative of the Pope dispatched to a country on a special mission.

公使是比大使级别低的外交代表。被派去执行特殊使命的公使被称为特使。教廷大使和使节是梵蒂冈国的外交代表。教廷大使是教皇派驻外国的大使；使节是教皇特使，即教皇派往某个国家执行特殊使命的外交代表。

A plenipotentiary describes any person fully empowered to represent a government, whether he be an ambassador, minister or envoy. The term is most commonly applied to minister plenipotentiary, who, though ranking below ambassadors, are nevertheless invested
with full authority to conduct important matters of state in the name of their government.

全权代表是指任何全权代表政府的人，无论他是大使、部长还是特使。该术语最常用于指全权部长，尽管他们的级别低于大使，但仍被赋予全权代表政府处理重要国家事务的权力。


4.28 Anarchism
These words all refer either to a general distrust of centralized government or to specific ideologies and their techniques for deliberately disrupting the fabric of an existing society in order to gain a stated set of goals.

这些词语要么指的是对中央集权政府的普遍不信任，要么指的是特定的意识形态及其为了达到既定目标而故意破坏现有社会结构的手段。

Anarchism has both philosophical and historical senses. In a philosophic framework, anarchism refers to a tendency that sees individual freedom threatened by any trend towards collectivism in government: Thoreau’s very personal anarchism stemmed from an absolute dislike for all institutions in general. Most specifically, the word refers to a historical movement of the 19 th and 20 th centuries that held all existing societies to be corrupt and proposed to destroy them. Some strains of anarchism proposed single acts of symbolic, pointless violence, which gave rise in the popular imagination of the 1890s to the figure of the bearded, bomb-throwing anarchist. One strain of militant anarchism was called Bajuninism after the Russian theorist who deeply influenced the development of Marxism. Another strain, known as syndicalism, foresaw a world-wide shut-down of industry by workers in order to cause the collapse of capitalism. After this "general strike," comparable to the world-wide revolution foreseen by Marx, workers would govern society directly through the trade-union structure. [The Industrial Workers of the World, known as Wobblies, were a curious group who sometimes appeared to advocate syndicalism, sometimes merely isolated acts of violent anarchism, and sometimes a systematic socialism.]

无政府主义既有哲学意义，也有历史意义。在哲学框架中，无政府主义指的是一种倾向，认为任何政府的集体主义趋势都会威胁个人自由：梭罗的个人无政府主义源于对所有机构的绝对厌恶。更具体地说，这个词指的是 19 世纪和 20 世纪的一场历史运动，该运动认为所有现存社会都是腐败的，并提议摧毁它们。一些无政府主义派别提议采取单一的象征性、毫无意义的暴力行为，这在 19 世纪 90 年代的大众想象中催生了留着胡子、投掷炸弹的无政府主义者的形象。一种激进的无政府主义派别被称为巴约宁主义，以纪念对马克思主义发展产生深远影响的俄罗斯理论家。另一种被称为工团主义的派别预见到工人将在全球范围内关闭工业，以导致资本主义崩溃。这次“总罢工”与马克思预见的世界革命类似，工人将通过工会结构直接管理社会。[世界产业工人组织，又称世界产业工人联盟，是一个奇怪的群体，他们有时似乎提倡工团主义，有时只是孤立的暴力无政府主义行为，有时又提倡系统性的社会主义。]

Pacifism is a strain of anarchism sharply distinguished from others by its total disavowal of violence. Often called pacifist anarchism, it applies especially, but not exclusively, to those who wish to abolish war and who agitate against any military solution of international problems.

和平主义是无政府主义的一种，与其他无政府主义截然不同，它完全拒绝暴力。它通常被称为和平主义无政府主义，特别适用于（但不限于）那些希望废除战争并反对任何国际问题军事解决方案的人。

Mahatma Gandhi, an adherent of pacifism and admittedly inspired by Thoreau’s philosophical anarchism, founded Gandhism (or satyagraha), a specific method of civil disobedience that successfully used non-violent techniques to free India of British rule.

圣雄甘地是和平主义的追随者，他无疑受到梭罗无政府主义哲学的启发，创立了甘地主义（或非暴力不合作主义），这是一种特殊的公民抗命方法，成功地利用非暴力手段将印度从英国的统治中解放出来。

Civil rights workers in America, agitating against the segregation of Negroes, at first deliberately adopted philosophical anarchism and the techniques of pacifism and Gandhism to win their goals. The phrase first used to describe this fusion of theory and method was passive resistance, but unwanted overtones in the phrase, implying helpless passivity, caused it to be rejected in favour of non-violence, a word now used by pacifists, non-violent anarchists, and integrationists alike to describe their methods. Non-violence implies active resistance to an unjust law or custom by such acts as demonstrations, boycotts and disruptions of the normal functioning of society.

美国民权工作者在反对种族隔离的斗争中，最初有意采用哲学无政府主义以及和平主义和甘地主义的技术来实现他们的目标。最初用来描述这种理论和方法融合的短语是消极抵抗，但该短语中不必要的含义暗示着无助的被动，导致它被拒绝，取而代之的是非暴力，现在和平主义者、非暴力无政府主义者和融合主义者都使用非暴力这个词来描述他们的方法。非暴力意味着通过示威、抵制和破坏社会正常运作等行为积极抵抗不公正的法律或习俗。

4.29 Ancestor
The words in this list are very close in meaning, each being most strictly applied to a person from whom one is descended. Ancestor, forbear and forefather are hardly ever applied to parents or grandparents, whereas progenitor is sometimes applied to them as well as to more remote ancestors. [Although Napoleon and his immediate progenitors were Corsicans, he is considered by most modern Frenchmen to have been as French as their own ancestors.]

此列表中的单词含义非常接近，每个单词都严格适用于某人的后裔。祖先、祖先和先祖几乎从不适用于父母或祖父母，而祖先有时既适用于他们，也适用于更远的祖先。[尽管拿破仑和他的直系祖先是科西嘉人，但大多数现代法国人认为他和他们的祖先一样法国化。]

Ancestor and progenitor are often applied to things other than people. [Eohippus is an ancestor of the horse; The progenitors of Italian lyric verse forms were those used by the troubadours of Provence.] Progenitor, in this sense, points to an early form that created, caused or led to the development of a newer one; ancestor, even in this extended sense, retains the idea of historical evolution, the course of which is determined by forces over which man has no control and little knowledge. [The impressionist movement was one of the ancestors of abstract art; Johnson’s dictionary was the progenitor of many others that followed its style and treatment of the language.]

祖先和原祖经常用于指代人以外的事物。[始祖马是马的祖先；意大利抒情诗形式的祖先是普罗旺斯的游吟诗人所使用的形式。] 祖先，在这个意义上，指的是创造、导致或引导新形式发展的早期形式；祖先，即使在这个延伸意义上，也保留了历史进化的概念，其进程由人类无法控制且知之甚少的力量决定。[印象派运动是抽象艺术的祖先之一；约翰逊词典是许多其他遵循其风格和语言处理方式的词典的先驱。]

Forefather and forbear are usually used in the plural. Forefathers is most often used in a poetical context and frequently connotes strong family or racial feeling, or continuing habitation in one place, whereas forbears has such connotations to a much smaller degree.

Forefather 和 forbear 通常以复数形式使用。Forefathers 最常用于诗歌中，经常表示强烈的家庭或种族情感，或持续居住在一个地方，而 forbears 的此类含义则小得多。

4.30 Ancient
Ancient means existing or occurring in times long past: ancient rituals; ancient coins. As applied to history, ancient refers to the period beginning with the earliest times and ending about the time of the fall of the Roman Empire in A.D. 476. Old, a more general word, must be qualified to avoid ambiguity. It may mean ancient: cowrie shells and other old forms of currency; or aged: Oxford is an old university; or it can be used as a substitute in some contexts for any of the other words in this group.

古代是指存在或发生在很久以前的时代：古代仪式；古代钱币。在历史上，古代​​是指从最早的时代开始，到公元 476 年罗马帝国灭亡时结束的时期。古代是一个更通用的词，必须加以限定以避免歧义。它可能意味着古老：贝壳和其他旧式货币；或古老：牛津是一所古老的大学；或者它可以在某些情况下代替该组中的任何其他词。

Antique is applied to that which has survived from the past, either from ancient times or from some less remote period. As used in describing furniture or other objects, antique may indicate an age of no more than several generations: an antique shop specializing in turn-of-the-century merchandise. Immemorial is applied to that which is so ancient that its origins are beyond all memory: immemorial customs. The word is often used in the phrase since time immemorial. Otherwise its use tends to sound grand and affected. Hoary, which literally means, white, grey, or having white or grey hair, is applied figuratively to things surviving from the distant past: hoary relics of ancient civilizations.

Antique 适用于从过去幸存下来的东西，无论是远古时代还是不太久远的时期。在描述家具或其他物品时，antique 可能表示年代不超过几代：一家专门经营世纪之交商品的古董店。Immemorial 适用于太古老以至于其起源超出所有记忆的东西：远古习俗。这个词经常用于短语 since time immemorial。否则，它的使用听起来会很夸张和做作。Hoary 的字面意思是白色、灰色或有白色或灰色的头发，用来比喻从遥远的过去幸存下来的东西：古代文明的古老遗迹。

4.31 Anger
These words denote, in varying degrees, feelings of strong displeasure or antagonism directed against the causes of an assumed wrong or injury. Anger, the most general word of this group, provides no clue as to the direction of this feeling or its means of expression. One may feel anger at an unfortunate turn of events, at oneself or at another person. Rage often implies a loss of self-control, and fury, the strongest word in the group, suggests a rage so violent that it may approach madness. [The surly insolence of the waiters drove him into a rage, and he flung his serviette to the floor and stalked out of the restaurant; They fury of a woman scorned, according to Congreve, is unmatched in hell; Mad with fury, he pounded his fists on the wall and beat his breast.]

这些词语在不同程度上表示对假定的错误或伤害的原因产生的强烈不满或敌意。愤怒是该词语中最常用的词语，它无法提供任何有关这种情感的方向或表达方式的线索。一个人可能会因为不幸的事态发展而感到愤怒，对自己或他人。愤怒通常意味着失去自我控制，而狂怒是该词语中最强烈的词语，它表示一种近乎疯狂的愤怒。[侍者的傲慢无礼使他勃然大怒，他把餐巾扔到地上，大步走出了餐厅；据康格里夫说，一个被轻视的女人所发出的愤怒在地狱中是无与伦比的；他怒不可遏，用拳头捶打墙壁，捶胸顿足。]

Indignation denotes anger based on a moral condemnation of something felt to be disgraceful or ignoble: Abolitionists viewed the institution of slavery with indignation. Wrath, now limited in use to literature and figures of speech, suggests a strong anger directed at some specific person or thing. The source of wrath is always impressive, sometimes divine; hence it traditionally inspires awe and fear: the wrath of the gods. Ire, meaning anger or indignation, is no longer encountered except in poetry and period literature: His ire was strongly provoked by the discourtesy of the host in failing to address him by his proper title.

愤慨表示对某些可耻或卑鄙之事的道德谴责而产生的愤怒：废奴主义者对奴隶制度感到愤慨。愤怒现在仅限于文学和修辞手法，表示对某个特定的人或事物的强烈愤怒。愤怒的来源总是令人印象深刻，有时是神圣的；因此它传统上激发敬畏和恐惧：众神的愤怒。愤怒，意思是愤怒或愤慨，除了在诗歌和时代文学中，现在再也见不到了：他的愤怒是由主人没有用正确的头衔称呼他的无礼行为引起的。

4.32 Animal
These words refer to living things other than plants. Animal may refer to all such beings, as in biological terminology where life is divided into two groups, plants and animals. In common use, however, the word is more specifically applied to all such beings with the exception of humans: man and the animals he lives among. The contexts of some uses, furthermore, make it clear that birds, fish and insects are also not included in the term. At its most restricted, the word can even refer strictly only to domestic quadrupeds: pigs, sheep, cattle and other animals. When the word is applied to a human being in other than a scientific context, the emphasis is on depravity or amorality: a disgusting animal who cared for no one but himself. Creature does not have this range of possibility in meaning; it refers invariably to all living beings other than plants: all God’s creatures. When a human being is referred to by this word, however, pity or contempt is usually present: the poor little creature, what a vile creature.

这些词指的是植物以外的生物。动物可以指所有这样的生物，就像生物学术语中生命分为两类：植物和动物。然而，在通常的使用中，这个词更具体适用于除人类以外的所有生物：人和他与之共生的动物。此外，一些用法的上下文清楚地表明，鸟类、鱼类和昆虫也不包括在这个术语中。在最严格的限制下，这个词甚至可以严格地仅指家养的四足动物：猪、羊、牛和其他动物。当这个词在科学背景之外用于人类时，强调的是堕落或不道德：一种令人厌恶的动物，只关心自己，不关心任何人。生物没有这种可能的含义范围；它总是指植物以外的所有生物：所有上帝的造物。然而，当用这个词来指人类时，通常会出现怜悯或蔑视：可怜的小动物，多么卑鄙的生物。

Beast and brute both restrict themselves to animals other than man, but especially to the higher mammals: lions, leopards and other beasts of the veldt; such beasts of burden as the donkey and the horse. While beast, thus, has a neutrally descriptive possibility, brute is charged with an emphasis on supposedly non-human qualities like wildness, viciousness or stupidity: the jungle rule of brute versus brute. More commonly, brute is used to describe a strong, cruel or stupid human being: a nasty brute of a man. Beast can also be applied to a human being, but unlike brute, it stresses mostly degradation and extreme inhumanity: the woman who was called the Beast of Belsen. In this use, beast is more pejorative than brute, but both are more negative than animal when it is used in this way. Beast refers also to farm animals raised for butchering.

野兽和残暴者都仅限于人类以外的动物，尤其是高等哺乳动物：狮子、豹子和其他草原野兽；驴和马等驮畜。因此，虽然野兽具有中性描述的可能性，但残暴者则强调了野性、恶毒或愚蠢等非人类特质：残暴者与残暴者的丛林法则。更常见的是，残暴者用来形容强壮、残忍或愚蠢的人：一个令人讨厌的残暴男人。野兽也可以用于人类，但与残暴者不同的是，它主要强调堕落和极度不人道：被称为贝尔森野兽的女人。在这种用法中，野兽比残暴者更贬义，但当两者以这种方式使用时，都比动物更负面。野兽也指饲养用于屠宰的农场动物。


4.33 Answer
These words apply primarily to something said or written to satisfy or acknowledge a question, call, request, charge, etc. Answer is the most general word in this list, and though all the words here considered may be used figuratively of actions as well as words, answer is more variously used than any of them. When a question is asked, any words or action in return may be called an answer: a prompt answer to a letter; His answer was an uppercut to the jaw. Indeed, any satisfactory conclusion may be styled an answer: He had hoped that divorce would be the answer to all his problems. An answer in the form of a statement appropriate to the question is a reply: His reply to the request was a firm "No!"

这些词主要适用于为了满足或承认问题、呼吁、请求、指控等而说出或写下的东西。答案是这个列表中最常用的词，虽然这里考虑的所有词都可以比喻为动作和词语，但答案的用法比任何一个都更多样化。当提出一个问题时，任何回应的话语或行动都可以称为答案：对信件的迅速答复；他的回答是一记上勾拳。事实上，任何令人满意的结论都可以称为答案：他曾希望离婚能解决他所有的问题。以 st 形式回答

A response is the reaction to a stimulus: Pavlov’s experiments proved that a conditioned response to a given stimulus could be induced in rats by the learned association of the right response with satisfaction and of the wrong response with pain. In more general use response refers to any answer to an urgent question or appeal, or to a set question: a response to a cry for help; the responses of a litany. A reply to a reply is a rejoinder, often in the form of a second question or demand; this word is particularly applicable to the give-and-take of a debate: a telling rejoinder which left his opponent momentarily speechless. Riposte, form the Italian word for answer, first meant a return thrust in fencing. By extension, it came to be applied to a verbal duel, meaning a quick, clever, retaliatory reply: a brilliant, if somewhat savage, riposte. A retort is a sharp answer, as to an accusation or criticism. The libellous accusation provoked a bitter retort.

反应是对刺激的反应：巴甫洛夫的实验证明，通过学习将正确的反应与满足感联系起来，将错误的反应与痛苦联系起来，可以诱导大鼠对给定刺激的条件反应。更广泛地说，反应是指对紧急问题或呼吁或固定问题的任何回答：对求助的回应；对一连串问题的回应。对答复的答复是一种反驳，通常以第二个问题或要求的形式出现；这个词特别适用于辩论中的互利：一种有力的反驳，让对手一时无言以对。Riposte 是意大利语中“回答”一词的变体，最初是指击剑中的反击。引申开来，它被用于口头决斗，意为快速、聪明、报复性的回答：一种精彩但有些野蛮的反驳。反驳是对指控或批评的尖锐回答。诽谤性的指控引发了激烈的反驳。

	ANTONYMS: QUESTION (n.).


4.34 Anxiety
These words describe troubled states of mind in which a person feels frustrated and helpless concerning his present situation, or in which he fears that some harmful event will occur in the future. Anxiety, the most general of these words, can relate on one hand to those words here that describe a fearful state of mind concerning the future: anxiety about the outcome of the election. Unlike any of these other words, however, it can refer to a fear of the future per se and not just of a single hazard. This meaning is particularly used by psychiatrists to refer to patients who are immobilized by such a feeling without being able to explain what it is they fear: The boy had been so mistreated that he faced each day with a vast, uncomprehending anxiety.
	
这些词语描述的是人内心的烦恼状态，对当前的处境感到沮丧和无助，或担心未来会发生一些有害事件。焦虑是这些词语中最常用的一个，一方面，它与这里描述对未来的恐惧状态的词语有关：对选举结果的焦虑。然而，与其他词语不同的是，它可以指对未来本身的恐惧，而不仅仅是对单一危险的恐惧。精神科医生特别使用这个意思来指被这种感觉所困扰，又无法解释他们害怕的是什么的患者：这个男孩受到了如此虐待，以至于他每天都面临着巨大的、无法理解的焦虑。

Anxiety also relates, on the other hand, to words of this group that are not necessarily tied to fear of the future. Existential philosophers developed this meaning to refer to the helpless, all-encompassing frustration of the human condition when confronted with the inexplicability of life. Recently this kind of anxiety is often referred to by the word angst, from the Danish of the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard: In the Age of Anxiety, W.H.Auden claims that our fear of the future is really a fear of ourselves and our own irrepressible.


另一方面，焦虑也与这组词语有关，而这些词语并不一定与对未来的恐惧有关。存在主义哲学家发展了这种含义，用来指人类在面对生活的不可解释时无助、无所不包的沮丧。最近，这种焦虑通常被称为 angst 一词，源自哲学家索伦·克尔凯郭尔的丹麦语：在焦虑时代，W.H.Auden 声称，我们对未来的恐惧实际上是对我们自己和我们自己无法抑制的恐惧。

Dread, apprehension and foreboding emphasize the fear of something that has yet to happen. Dread is the most intense of any of the words listed here, with overtones of helplessness in the face of something as inevitable as it is terrible. The thing dreaded may be a specific occurrence or a less well-defined evil that is none the less terrifying to consider. [During the international crisis everyone was filled with the dread of nuclear war; She did not know what to expect on the dark road ahead, but every shadow filled her with dread.] The word can, of course, be used hyperbolically for more trivial occasions: I dread the rush-hour traffic so much that I often avoid it by coming late to work. Apprehension is more formal than either dread or anxiety, less intense in feeling, and applies to vaguer fears of a future happening. It is not so much a harmful inevitability that is foreseen as an uncertain outcome that keeps one in suspense: No matter how perfect the weather, she never conquered the apprehension with which she saw him off at the airport. Like anxiety, foreboding is midway between dread and apprehension in it formality, its intensity and its conviction of certain or possible harm. What sets this word aside is its aura of superstition: Because it rained on her wedding day, she spent the rest of the week in gloomy foreboding. The word can be used without this overtone in which case it points to a more general nagging doubt about the future: He carried his report home with a sharp foreboding of the nasty scene he would face that evening.

恐惧、忧虑和预感强调对尚未发生的事情的恐惧。恐惧是这里列出的所有词语中最强烈的，带有面对不可避免的可怕事情的无助感。恐惧的事情可能是特定事件，也可能是定义不明确的邪恶，但考虑起来仍然令人恐惧。[在国际危机期间，每个人都对核战争充满恐惧；她不知道前方黑暗的道路上会发生什么，但每一个阴影都让她心生恐惧。]当然，这个词也可以在更琐碎的场合夸张地使用：我非常害怕高峰时段的交通，所以我经常迟到来避免它。忧虑比恐惧或焦虑更正式，感觉不那么强烈，适用于对未来发生的事情的模糊恐惧。预感并不是预见到某种有害的必然性，而是让人悬念不断的不确定结果：不管天气多么好，她都无法克服在机场送别他时的忐忑。像焦虑一样，预感介于恐惧和忧虑之间，既正式又强烈，并且确信肯定会造成伤害或可能造成伤害。这个词的不同之处在于它带有迷信的气息：因为她结婚那天下雨了，所以接下来的一周她都闷闷不乐地度过。这个词可以不带这种含义，在这种情况下，它指的是对未来的更普遍的挥之不去的怀疑：他带着报告回家，强烈预感到当晚将要面对的可怕场面。

Worry is far less formal than the previous words and implies an obsessive concern for far more mundane matters. It frequently appears in the plural. [Forget your worries and relax.] It is often used as an abstraction for a habit of mind that compulsively frets about the future without real result: Worry never makes up for what hard work could have accomplished.

忧虑远不如前几个词正式，它暗示着对更平凡的事情的过度关注。它经常以复数形式出现。[忘记你的忧虑，放松一下。] 它通常被用作一种抽象的思维习惯，这种习惯强迫性地担心未来而没有真正的结果：忧虑永远无法弥补努力工作所能取得的成就。

Misgiving is doubt about the outcome of an action, or a feeling of apprehension provoked by such doubt: He had some misgivings about investing in the stock, and when he saw the company’s annual report he knew at once they were justified. Uneasiness and disquiet, unlike misgiving, do not necessarily apply to fear about the future. Both suggest that actual physical discomfort or restlessness accompanies the apprehensive or fearful state, uneasiness most strongly so. Disquiet refers to a more subtle uneasiness over an often ill-defined danger. [What had at first been merely a faint disquiet as the minutes passed became at last outright uneasiness that set him to pacing about the hospital’s waiting room.]

疑虑是对行动结果的怀疑，或由这种怀疑引起的忧虑感：他对投资股票有些疑虑，当他看到公司的年度报告时，他立刻知道这些疑虑是合理的。不安和不安与疑虑不同，不一定适用于对未来的恐惧。两者都表明，实际的身体不适或不安伴随着忧虑或恐惧状态，不安最为强烈。不安指的是对通常定义不明确的危险的更微妙的不安。[起初只是一种微弱的不安，但随着时间的流逝，这种不安最终变成了彻底的不安，让他在医院的候诊室里踱步。]

4.35 Appearance
These words all used to denote visual impressions of the way a person or thing is or seems. Appearance, in the sense here considered, is the most neutral of these terms, making only a flat assertion of what one perceives. [It had the appearance of an 18 th century church; He had the rugged appearance of an athlete.] Appearance, however, like the other words, can be used to accent the contrast between what seems to be so and what is the fact of the matter: a despot who assumes the appearance of a benefactor.

这些词都用来表示对人或事物的外表或样子的视觉印象。在这里考虑的意义上，外表是这些术语中最中性的，只是对人们所感知到的东西做出平淡的断言。[它看起来像一座 18 世纪的教堂；他看起来像一个运动员。]然而，外表和其他词一样，可以用来强调表面上和事实之间的对比：一个假装是恩人的暴君。

Look usually applies to facial expression or demeanour rather than to other forms of appearance, such as dress, although it may ?implying a analogy with a person’s face ?be used to describe things as well: a Renaissance look to a building. Compare these two phrases: the
appearance of a snob; the look of a snob. The former suggests  dandyish clothes and a too-elegant manner; the latter suggests, along with other qualities, a supercilious expression.

Look 通常适用于面部表情或举止，而不是其他形式的外表，例如着装，尽管它可能（暗示与人的面部相似）也可用于描述事物：建筑物的文艺复兴风格。比较这两个短语：势利眼的外表；势利眼的外表。前者暗示时髦的衣服和过于优雅的举止；后者暗示傲慢的表情以及其他品质。

Aspect is often interchangeable with look, but suggests more strongly  the changing nature of appearance as it confronts the beholder: the pleasant aspect of a lake; an artist who had the aspect of a prizefighter. Aspect implies that the perception is a quality inherent in the thing perceived, a quality that is drawn out ?into focus, as it were ?by the eye of the beholder.

外观通常与外观互换使用，但更强烈地暗示了外观在观察者面前的变化性质：湖泊的宜人景色；具有职业拳击手外观的艺术家。外观意味着感知是被感知事物固有的品质，这种品质被观察者的眼睛“聚焦”。

Semblance is almost invariably used to contrast appearance with reality: a doubtful assertion that has the semblance of truth; an enemy who cloaks his threats with the semblance of civility. It may however, be used to mean outward appearance without any suggestion of falseness: The faceless person in his dreams began to acquire the semblance of his dead brother.

外表几乎总是用来对比外表与现实：一个看似真理的可疑断言；一个用彬彬有礼的外表来掩饰威胁的敌人。然而，它也可以用于表示没有任何虚假暗示的外表：梦中的无脸人开始变得像他死去的兄弟。


4.36 Applause
These words refer to simultaneous expressions of approval or  praise by a number of persons. Applause may be given by voice or by clapping the hands. The word does not suggest any particular degree of enthusiasm, and depends on context or qualifying adjectives to indicate the intensity or sincerity of the approval. [At the end of the concert, the pianist was greeted with a smattering of applause.] Acclaim and acclamation are more formal terms, and refer specifically to vocal expressions of praise or approval. In parliamentary bodies, a measure adopted by acclamation is one adopted by shouts of approval and applause rather than by individual votes; by acclamation can therefore be taken to mean by enthusiastic endorsement of the assembly. Acclaim need not refer particularly to actual cries of approval, but is perhaps more commonly used nowadays to express figurative applause: Einstein’s achievements earned him the acclaim of the entire scientific community. Plaudit, also a formal term, means a burst of applause, but, like acclaim, is often used figuratively, commonly in the plural: to receive the plaudits of one’s fellow musicians for an outstanding performance.

这些词指许多人同时表示赞同或赞扬。掌声可以通过声音或拍手来表示。这个词并不表示任何特定的热情程度，而是根据上下文或限定形容词来表明赞同的强度或真诚程度。[音乐会结束时，钢琴家受到了一阵阵掌声。]Acclaim 和 acclamation 是更正式的术语，特指口头表达的赞扬或赞同。在议会机构中，以欢呼方式通过的措施是通过赞同和掌声而不是个人投票通过的措施；因此，acclamation 可以理解为对大会的热烈支持。Acclaim 并不一定特指实际的赞同呼声，但现在可能更常用于表达比喻性的掌声：爱因斯坦的成就为他赢得了整个科学界的赞誉。 Plaudit 也是一个正式术语，意思是爆发出的掌声，但是，与 acclaim 一样，经常用来比喻，通常用复数形式：因出色的表演而受到同行音乐家的喝彩。

4.37 Appoint
The situation that unites these words is one in which a person is being chosen to fulfil a given function by someone else. Unlike other ways of matching people to tasks, these words imply an official situation ?in an office, club or government ?in which the choice is made by means other than an elective process. Appoint indicates that the selection is made by someone officially charged with this duty, although the actual selection itself may be arbitrary or judicious: Members of Parliament are elected by the people, while public officials are appointed by the Crown. Of this set name is the most informal and tells least about the chooser or the method of choice adopted: Since no one has volunteered, I hereby name the following to serve on the entertainment committee. Thus the word sometimes stresses outcome rather than process: a judge named as a party to the decision.

这两个词联合起来的情况是指某人被其他人选中去履行某项职责。与其他将人与任务相匹配的方式不同，这两个词指的是一种正式的情况（在办公室、俱乐部或政府中），其中的选择是通过选举过程以外的其他方式做出的。Appoint 表示选择是由正式担负此职责的人做出的，尽管实际选择本身可能是任意的或明智的：议会成员由人民选举产生，而公职人员由王室任命。在这组中，name 是最不正式的，最少说明选择者或所采用的选择方法：由于没有人自愿，我在此提名以下人员担任娱乐委员会成员。因此，这个词有时强调结果而不是过程：被提名为决策一方的法官。

Designate is the most formal of all these terms, even to the point of stiffness. It can be useful to distinguish from appoint a process of selection that is only quasi-official in nature: The new manager esignated as his secretary the girl who had been head of the typing pool.

在所有术语中，Designate 是最正式的，甚至可以说是生硬的。将其与 appoint 区分开来很有用，appoint 是一种半官方性质的选拔过程：新经理任命了一位曾担任打字组组长的女孩作为他的秘书。

Assign differs from the other words here in that it most often refers, not to the picking of a person for a task, but to the delegation of a task to one or more members of a group. It has a overtone, not invariably present, of arbitrariness, possibly a resentment of having no say in what has been assigned to us. It is occasionally used of people rather than of the task, in this case, the person being assigned usually joins others already designated in a common task: Jones is assigned to mess duty, Smith is assigned to guard duty, and Anderson is assigned to the quartermaster’s store.

Assign 与此处的其他词语不同，它通常不是指挑选一个人来执行某项任务，而是指将某项任务委派给一个团队中的一个或多个成员。它带有一种并非总是存在的任意性含义，可能是一种对分配给我们的任务没有发言权的不满。它有时用于指人而不是指任务，在这种情况下，被指派的人通常会与已经指定执行共同任务的其他人一起：琼斯被指派负责食堂工作，史密斯被指派负责警卫工作，安德森被指派负责军需官的仓库。

4.38 Approval
These words are used for the formal assent given to a proposed undertaking or for the official honour given upon the successful completion of a task. Approval is the most general and least formal of these. In the official context, it usually means the giving of permission to undertake a task. [We can’t introduce our bill in the House without first getting the committee’s approval; Would you initial this requisition as a sign of your approval?] It can also simply mean concurrence in opinion: Your suggestion met with the principal’s highest approval.
	
这些词用于表示对拟议任务的正式同意或对成功完成任务给予的官方荣誉。其中，批准是最普遍和最不正式的。在官方语境中，它通常意味着允许执行任务。[我们不能在未获得委员会批准的情况下在众议院提出我们的法案；您是否会在这份申请书上签字以表示您的批准？]它也可以简单地表示意见一致：您的建议得到了校长的最高认可。

Approbation, the most formal of these, refers to the giving of  authoritative approval, especially in an ecclesiastical context. It carries overtones of warmth and congeniality in a more general context, but its use ?even in many official situations ?might be thought unnecessarily pretentious: His controversial report gained the hearty approbation of other experts in his field.
	
认可是最正式的，指的是给予权威的认可，尤其是在教会背景下。它在更一般的语境中带有温暖和亲切的意味，但它的使用——即使在许多官方场合——也可能被认为不必要地自命不凡：他的有争议的报告得到了该领域其他专家的衷心认可。

Commendation and sanction, more formal than approval, are both limited almost exclusively to an official context. Commendation is further restricted, within this context, to formal recognition for a task well done: a commendation for your brilliant sales record. The word can also refer to the written document of commendation: He framed his commendation for bravery and hung it on the wall. Sanction can mean either before-the-act approval or after-the-act commendation. [I’m sure you can get the committee’s sanction to proceed for the way he had acted.] Caution must be observed in the use of this word for it can also mean, confusingly enough, official restrictive measures taken against a proposed act, a group of people, or a group’s behaviour: The anti-noise group said it would recommend sanctions against those factories that still offended.

表彰和制裁比批准更为正式，两者几乎都仅限于官方语境。在这种语境中，表彰进一步局限于对出色完成任务的正式认可：对你出色销售记录的表彰。这个词还可以指书面的表彰文件：他把对勇敢的表彰裱起来挂在墙上。制裁既可以表示事前的批准，也可以表示事后的表彰。[我相信你能让委员会批准他所做的事。]使用这个词时必须谨慎，因为它也可能表示针对拟议行为、一群人或一个群体的行为采取的官方限制措施，这很容易让人混淆：反噪音组织表示将建议对那些仍然违法的工厂实施制裁。

4.39 Approximately
These words all mean within some degree of exactness or closeness, as in distance, time, amount, etc. approximately implies accuracy so near to a standard that the difference is not significant. [It was approximately 100?in the shade; p is approximately 3.1415.]

这些词都表示在一定程度的精确度或接近度内，如距离、时间、数量等。近似表示准确度非常接近标准，差异并不大。[阴影处约为 100?；p 约为 3.1415。]

About is often used interchangeably with approximately, but it does not stress the closeness to accuracy that approximately does: a hat costing about five dollars; reaching home at about dinnertime. Around sometimes appears in informal contexts in place of approximately or about: to go to bed around midnight; to invite around fifteen people to a picnic.
	
About 经常与 approximate 互换使用，但它并不像 approximate 那样强调接近准确性：一顶帽子价值约 5 美元；大约在晚餐时间到家。Around 有时在非正式语境中代替 approximate 或 about：午夜左右上床睡觉；邀请大约十五个人去野餐。
 
Roughly is often used in place of approximately or about when there is no real attempt to be exact. [The cost of the car repairs was estimated at roughly fifty dollars; The population of London is roughly 8,000,000.] Roughly also carries a suggestion of casualness or haste, which the other words do not convey. [The books were shelved roughly in alphabetical order; Roughly speaking, I would guess that we are headed for a depression.]

当没有真正尝试精确时，Roughly 经常用来代替近似或大约。[汽车维修费用估计约为五十美元；伦敦人口约为 8,000,000。] Roughly 还带有随意或匆忙的意思，而其他词语则没有传达这些意思。[这些书大致按字母顺序排列；粗略地说，我猜我们正走向萧条。]

4.40 Argue
All these words mean to talk with others in order to reach an agreement, to persuade, or to settle a question of fact. Argue, themost general in the list, may refer to a reasoned presentation of views or to a heated exchange of opinion amounting to a quarrel. [The Senator argued his position with such cogency and wit that even his adversaries were impressed; They argued vociferously over who should pay the bill.] Debate means to argue formally, usually under the control of a referee and according to a set of regulations: The House of Representatives debated the proposal for three days. Any argument in which each person has strongly held opinions, however, can be styled a debate. Debate is also used less formally to mean to consider or think about alternative: They debated about which train to take.

所有这些词的意思都是与他人交谈以达成协议、说服或解决事实问题。argue 是这个列表中最常用的词，可能指有理有据的观点陈述，也可能指激烈的意见交换，甚至达到争吵的程度。[参议员如此有说服力和机智地辩论自己的立场，甚至他的对手都为之折服；他们激烈地争论谁应该付账。]debate 意味着正式辩论，通常在裁判的控制下并按照一套规定进行：众议院就该提案进行了三天的辩论。然而，任何每个人都持有强烈意见的争论都可以称为辩论。debate 也有不太正式的用法，表示考虑或思考替代方案：他们争论该坐哪趟火车。

Discuss means to talk over, usually in an informal, friendly way. It implies that the participants have less intensely held opinions than in a debate, and emphasizes their common desire to resolve the question satisfactorily: a committee appointed to discuss and formulate recommendations on how to improve job opportunities for the under-privileged. Discuss points to the elucidation of an issue rather than to the narrow presentation of one’s own view.

讨论是指讨论，通常以非正式、友好的方式进行。这意味着参与者的观点不像辩论那样激烈，并强调他们希望圆满解决问题的共同愿望：任命一个委员会来讨论并制定如何改善弱势群体就业机会的建议。讨论指的是阐明问题，而不是狭隘地表达自己的观点。

Reason means to argue or discuss in a careful and painstaking manner in order to persuade or explore a subject in depth: Supreme Court judges reasoning with one another in interpreting the legislation.

推理的意思是，为了说服或深入探讨某个主题，以仔细、细致的方式进行争论或讨论：最高法院的法官在解释立法时会互相推理。

Dispute, in this context, means to argue with more passion than logic, often from a factional point of view: Adherents of rival candidates for office frequently fall to disputing about subtle rules of procedure.

在这种情况下，争议意味着争论时充满激情而非逻辑，通常是从派系的角度出发：竞争对手的追随者经常会就微妙的议事规则展开争论。

4.41 Arise
These words refer to the development of one thing out of another. Arise suggests a chain of causality, possibly from simple to complex: new social organizations arising from the industrial revolution. Emerge suggests a gradual process that stresses simple change more than causality: a parliamentary system emerging slowly from the old order of absolute monarchy. Originate stresses the starting point for change: egalitarian sentiments that originated in contract theories of government. Result, by contrast, stresses the end product of change: contract theories of government that resulted in the growth of egalitarian sentiments.

这些词指的是一件事物从另一件事物发展而来。Arise 表示因果关系链，可能从简单到复杂：工业革命产生的新社会组织。Emerge 表示一个渐进的过程，强调简单的变化而不是因果关系：议会制从旧绝对君主制中缓慢发展而来。Originate 强调变革的起点：源于政府契约理论的平等主义情感。相比之下，Result 强调变革的最终产品：导致平等主义情感增长的政府契约理论。

Stem is closely related to originate in stressing the beginning of change, and like arise in stressing direct causation; it usually appears with from: a new anti-noise by-law that stemmed from local residents?indignation over the blaring din from the dance hall. Issue is similar in force to stem more than a decade of experimentation in the arts. Emanate, the most formal of these words so far, stresses the point of origin like originate, stem and issue, but it might be thought too formal for many contexts. It can, however, suggest a less clearly defined pattern of causation to which many imponderable factors may have contributed: a new sense of security emanating from greater prosperity and a lessening of international tension.

Stem 与 originate 密切相关，强调变化的开始，与 rise 类似，强调直接因果关系；它通常与 from 一起出现：一项新的反噪音条例，源于当地居民对舞厅喧闹声的愤慨。Issue 的力量与 stem 相似，这是十多年的艺术实验。Emanate 是迄今为止这些词中最正式的，强调起源点，如 originate、stem 和 issue，但它可能被认为在许多情况下过于正式。然而，它可以表明一种定义不太明确的因果关系模式，许多不可估量的因素可能促成了这种模式：一种新的安全感，源于更大的繁荣和国际紧张局势的缓解。

4.42 Arms
These words pertain to the guns and other military equipment used in fighting wars. Arms and weapons are general terms, nearly interchangeable, for the instruments of combat. A bow-and-arrow, sword or rifle are all arms or weapons. Of the two terms, arms is more frequently restricted in use to those weapons that an individual soldier can wield, whereas weapons are anything used in the fight, from chance sticks and stones to hydrogen bombs. In its most general sense, arms can also refer to the whole military capability of a country: Both nations bankrupted themselves in their foolish race to manufacture arms.
	
这些词指的是战争中使用的枪支和其他军事装备。军备和武器是通用术语，几乎可以互换，指的是作战工具。弓箭、剑或步枪都是军备或武器。在这两个术语中，军备的使用更经常局限于单个士兵可以使用的武器，而武器则是战斗中使用的任何东西，从棍棒和石头到氢弹。在最一般的意义上，军备也可以指一个国家的整体军事能力：这两个国家都在愚蠢的军备制造竞赛中破产了。

Armament is similar in meaning to this last sense of arms, but it is much clearer in that it points without confusion both to the weapons includes the most versatile planes, the fastest ships and the most rugged tanks in the world. Armament may also be used to refer to the total weapons available to a military vehicle: The destroyer’s armament consists of several small cannon, two torpedo tubes and a number of anti-aircraft guns. Ordnance may be used, like armament, for the total military effort of a country, but much more commonly refers specifically to heavy firearms, mounted cannon or mortars, and other heavy artillery.

Armament 的含义与 arms 的后一种含义相似，但更明确地指出，它指的是包括世界上最通用的飞机、最快的舰船和最坚固的坦克在内的武器。Armament 也可用于指军用车辆可用的全部武器：驱逐舰的武器包括几门小型火炮、两个鱼雷发射管和一些防空炮。与 armment 一样，Ordnance 可用于指一个国家的全部军事力量，但更常见的是，它特指重型火器、机载火炮或迫击炮以及其他重型火炮。

Materiel and munitions both refer to equipment rather than to weapons. Materiel suggests all the supporting equipment and supplies necessary to combat, while munitions most commonly suggests ammunition only: Dry socks are as important an item of materiel as munitions.

Materiel 和 munitions 都指装备而非武器。Materiel 指战斗所需的所有辅助装备和补给，而 munitions 则通常仅指弹药：干袜子和弹药一样都是重要的物资。

Arsenal and deterrent have come into fairly recent use to refer to a country’s nuclear arms. Arsenal previously meant simply a place where weapons are stored, but in this specific instance it indicates a stockpile of nuclear warheads. Deterrent is an almost euphemistic word for a nuclear arsenal: The atomic arsenal of either nation alone could lay waste to the entire planet, yet each emerging country clamours to build its own deterrent as well.

军火库和威慑最近才开始用来指一个国家的核武器。军火库以前只是储存武器的地方，但在这个特定情况下，它指的是核弹头的储备。威慑几乎是核武库的委婉说法：两个国家的原子武库都足以摧毁整个地球，但每个新兴国家都吵着要建立自己的威慑力量。

4.43 Artificial
Artificial or imitation may be applied to anything made by human beings in the form of something natural: artificial flowers; imitation wood-grain. Synthetic is synonymous with artificial in this sense, but there is a connotation in synthetic of production by chemical combinations or similar techniques: synthetic rubber. False and ersatz both suggest a substitute made because of the costliness or lack of the original item: false teeth; the proliferation of ersatz goods during periods of war and inflation. False often implies the presenting of a misleading appearance when it refers to a function-masking decorative detail: false drawers that were actually a single door concealing stereo equipment. Ersatz or imitation commonly describes a cheap or inferior copy that can fool no one: bowls of wax fruit, and a dusty collection of ersatz flowers in brass-plated planters.

人造或仿制品可用于指任何以自然形式由人类制造的物品：人造花；仿木纹。从这个意义上讲，合成与人造同义，但合成中还有通过化学组合或类似技术生产的含义：合成橡胶。假货和代用品都指由于原装物品昂贵或缺乏而制造的替代品：假牙；战争和通货膨胀时期代用品的泛滥。假货在指掩盖功能的装饰细节时，通常暗示呈现误导性的外观：假抽屉实际上是一扇隐藏立体声设备的单门。代用品或仿制品通常描述无法欺骗任何人的廉价或劣质复制品：一碗碗蜡制的水果，以及镀铜花盆里一堆布满灰尘的代用品。

4.44 Artisan
These words all refer to makers or constructors of products at some level below that of artistic creation. An artisan falls midway between the full-scale artist who creates single inimitable words and the mere worker who turns out identical, anonymous products: Italian artisans were imported to New York expressly to hand-carve the masonry on the brownstone buildings of the 1890s. Artisan was once much closer in meaning to artist, as witness the stained-glass windows of a medieval cathedral. These were created by anonymous artisans, but they are often great works of art none the less. Artificer still can suggest its earliest meaning of a worker who possesses mechanical facility: the artificer in an infantry company who cares for and repairs its weapons. In other uses artificer had begun to sound fusty until James Joyce re-introduced the word in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man to stand for the artist as creator and controller of art and life. It has sometimes been used since in this highest sense.

这些词都指制造或建造某种程度上低于艺术创作水平的产品的人。工匠介于创造单一独特词语的全面艺术家和生产相同、匿名产品的普通工人之间：19 世纪 90 年代，意大利工匠被特意带到纽约，手工雕刻褐砂石建筑的砖石。工匠的含义曾经与艺术家更接近，中世纪大教堂的彩色玻璃窗就是明证。这些是由匿名工匠制作的，但它们通常都是伟大的艺术品。工匠仍然可以暗示其最早的含义，即拥有机械设施的工人：步兵连中负责保养和修理武器的工匠。在其他用法中，工匠听起来有些过时，直到詹姆斯·乔伊斯在《青年艺术家肖像》中重新引入了这个词，以代表作为艺术和生活的创造者和控制者的艺术家。从那时起，它有时被用作这个最高意义。

Craftsman has risen somewhat in the scale to the artist end of the spectrum since the advent of machine-made objects in the 19 th century: Replaced by factories, the furniture-maker, the bookbinder, the dyer and the weaver were all skilled craftsmen whose century-old secrets were lost during the industrial revolution. Craftsman is now a common term to describe a worker in the minor arts; a ceramist or a pottery-maker would not feel insulted to be called a craftsman. In the other arts, the word is used of an artist unusually adept in the technical aspects of his art: The young poet was an extraordinary craftsman simply from the standpoint of the variety of poetic forms that he could command effectively.

自 19 世纪机器制造的物品出现以来，工匠一词在范围上已有所上升，成为艺术家：家具制造者、装订者、染工和织布工被工厂取代，他们都是技术娴熟的工匠，而百年来的秘诀在工业革命期间已失传。工匠现在已成为描述小众艺术工作者的常用术语；陶瓷师或陶器制造者不会因为被称为工匠而感到受辱。在其他艺术领域，该词用于描述在其艺术技术方面异常熟练的艺术家：这位年轻的诗人是一位非凡的工匠，仅从他能够有效掌握的多种诗歌形式的角度来看。

Creator and designer in the minor arts are parallel terms and imply the existence of a subordinate who carries a plan into effect. The person named on the playbill as the creator of a play’s costumes conceived and sketched them; someone else probably made them. A fashion, book-cover or car designer plans the physical appearance of the completed product down to the smallest detail, but craftsmen and other workers actually make up or build according to the designs.	

小艺术中的创作者和设计师是平行的术语，表示存在一个执行计划的下属。剧目单上列出的戏剧服装创作者构思并绘制了服装草图；服装可能是其他人制作的。时装、书籍封面或汽车设计师会规划成品的外观，直至最小的细节，但工匠和其他工人实际上是根据设计进行制作或建造的。

Workman implies someone who has more craftsmanship than a worker would possess but far less than an artisan. [We called in an artisan to repair the broken base of our Sèvres vase; At the same time, workmen arrived to fix our leaky roof.]

工人指的是那些技艺比工人高但比工匠差很多的人。[我们请了一位工匠来修理我们塞夫勒花瓶破损的底座；与此同时，工人也来修理我们漏水的屋顶。]

4.45 Artist
These words refer to people who produce works of art. Artist, in one of its uses, is the most general and all-inclusive of these, indicating a practitioner of any one of the fine or applied arts: artists who paint, compose music, or write novels. Its main usefulness lies in the fact that it can refer equally well as a group word to workers in diverse fields: a section of the city where all kinds of artists lived. By extension, the word is often used of someone who shows unusual taste or discrimination in other tasks: a real artist when it came to planning and giving interesting parties. When the word is not clearly a group word, however, it can often be taken to apply more strictly to the visual arts, especially to painting: a gathering place for artists and writers. Painter thus specifically emphasizes one of the possible meanings of artist, to the exclusion of all others. In general, artist can be replaced to advantage by the more specific term whenever appropriate: gatherings of painters, sculptors, novelists, poets and composers.

这些词指的是创作艺术作品的人。艺术家，在其用法之一中，是最普遍和最全面的，指的是任何一种美术或应用艺术的从业者：绘画、作曲或写小说的艺术家。它的主要用处在于，它可以作为一个群体词，同样指不同领域的工作者：城市中居住着各种艺术家的地区。延伸而言，这个词通常用来指在其他任务中表现出不同寻常的品味或辨别力的人：在策划和举办有趣的聚会时，真正的艺术家。然而，当这个词不明显是一个群体词时，它通常可以更严格地适用于视觉艺术，尤其是绘画：艺术家和作家的聚会场所。因此，画家特别强调了艺术家的一个可能含义，排除了所有其他含义。一般来说，只要合适，艺术家就可以用更具体的术语来代替：画家、雕塑家、小说家、诗人和作曲家的聚会。

The remaining words all relate to artist, rather than painter, in grouping a variety of specific roles under one general heading. Creator emphasizes the origination of artistic ideas by single person; it may or may not imply that others being the idea to its realization: the creator of huge canvasses teeming with scenes of Venetian life; a man credited as the creator of a film on which many had collaborated. The word also has a use to refer to an artist who works in a number of media: the creator of frescoes, architectural designs and sonnets. The word is also used in the applied arts, sometimes to lend aesthetic appeal to business: the creator of a new line of autumn fashions.

其余的词都与艺术家有关，而不是与画家有关，将各种特定角色归入一个总标题下。创作者强调艺术创意由一个人发起；它可能暗示也可能不暗示其他人参与了创意的实现：创作了充满威尼斯生活场景的巨幅画布的人；被誉为许多人合作拍摄的电影的创作者。这个词也用于指代在多种媒体上工作的艺术家：壁画、建筑设计和十四行诗的创作者。这个词也用于应用艺术，有时是为了给商业增添美感：秋季新系列时装的创造者。

Craftsman, stylist and virtuoso are general words that emphasize technical skill or flair when substituted for artist. In this context, craftsman suggests any artist who lavishes painstaking care on the construction of his work and is consciously concerned with fine details: a real craftsman in his ability to shape dialogue towards natural and inevitable climaxes. Stylist suggests an artist unusually gifted with a flair for working in one of the short story. The word can also be used of lesser or applied arts to suggest singularity or professionality: hair stylist; a unique song stylist. Virtuoso originally applied to a musical performer who was able to execute difficult passages with apparent ease and bravura. Now it may refer to any artist, as well, who shows unique mastery of technical difficulties or is especially given to display of technical facility: a virtuoso in the sonnet form; a virtuoso who, for all his technique, remains a shallow and superficial artist.

工匠、造型师和演奏家是用来代替艺术家的一般用词，强调技术技能或天赋。在这种情况下，工匠指任何在作品制作上倾注大量心血并有意识地关注细节的艺术家：真正的工匠能够将对话塑造成自然而不可避免的高潮。造型师指在短篇小说中工作时具有非凡天赋的艺术家。这个词也可用于次要艺术或应用艺术，以表明独特性或专业性：发型师；独特的歌曲造型师。演奏家最初是指能够轻松而华丽地演奏困难乐段的音乐表演者。现在它也可以指任何表现出对技术难题的独特掌握或特别擅长展示技术能力的艺术家：十四行诗形式的演奏家；尽管拥有所有技巧，但仍是肤浅和肤浅的艺术家的演奏家。

4.46 Artistic
These words describe qualities in a work of art, its creator or its appreciator. Artistic and aesthetic are closely related; most simply, the artistic instinct belongs to the creator, the aesthetic instinct to the beholder: artistic skill; aesthetic pleasure. In another sense, however, the aesthetic attitude might be taken as generic, the artistic attitude as a specific but by no means exhaustive example of the more general term. In this distinction, the aesthetic instinct expresses itself in all areas of life where taste, discrimination, style and balance are desirable: an aesthetic flower arrangement; an aesthetic flair for matching the right wine to the right entrée. In yet another sense, aesthetic describes specifically those discriminations sorted out by aestheticians; one connotation here may be unnecessary refinement or passivity as opposed to the boldness and activity of the artistic attitude: too bogged down in aesthetic distinctions to have any artistic spontaneity. In describing a work of art rather than an attitude, aesthetic would be largely irrelevant, artistic inane or tautological. Both may be used to praise creations not commonly thought of as works of art: an artistic grouping of furniture.

这些词描述了一件艺术品、其创作者或欣赏者的品质。艺术和审美密切相关；简单地说，艺术本能属于创作者，审美本能属于观赏者：艺术技巧；审美愉悦。然而，从另一个意义上讲，审美态度可以看作是一般性的，艺术态度是更一般术语的一个具体但绝不详尽的例子。在这种区别中，审美本能体现在生活中所有需要品味、辨别力、风格和平衡的领域：一种审美的插花；一种将合适的葡萄酒与合适的主菜搭配在一起的审美天赋。从另一个意义上讲，审美专门描述了美学家整理出的那些辨别力；这里的一个含义可能是不必要的精致或被动，而不是艺术态度的大胆和积极：过于拘泥于审美区别而没有任何艺术自发性。在描述一件艺术品而不是一种态度时，审美在很大程度上是不相关的、艺术空洞的或同义反复的。两者都可用于赞美通常不被认为是艺术品的创作：家具的艺术组合。

Arty and mannered both refer to attitudes that tend towards parody of the artistic sensibility. Arty, the more strongly negative of the two, is also the most informal of any of these words. It suggests the phoniness of the poseur or artist manqué, stressing particularly that exaggerated and affected behaviour that may be totally unrelated to the creation of works of art: the arty bohemian crowd in Greewich Village. Mannered is more formal and more restrained in its disapproval. It suggests behaviour that is contrived and unnatural, the mannered, fey look of her costume. The word can also refer to the work of art itself, suggesting the same qualities of contrived artificiality.

Arty 和 moraled 都指倾向于戏仿艺术感性的态度。Arty 是这两个词中否定性更强的一个，也是这两个词中最不正式的一个。它暗示装腔作势者或艺术家的虚伪，特别强调那些夸张和做作的行为，这些行为可能与艺术作品的创作完全无关：比如希腊村的波西米亚艺术群体。Mannered 更正式，在反对时也更为克制。它暗示行为做作和不自然，以及她服装的做作、怪异的外观。这个词也可以指艺术作品本身，暗示同样的做作的造作性质。

Artificial most often refers only to the work, suggesting a lack of spontaneity and of naturalness. It is more negative in tone than mannered. The latter may suggest worthwhile Artificial content that has been harmed by unnecessary stylistic manipulation., on the other hand, suggests a lack of content that a pretentious style is struggling to conceal. Stylized is like mannered and artificial in suggesting an emphasis on mode as opposed to content, but it contrasts with them in ranging from a neutral to an approving tone; the stylized patterns of the kabuki dances. It emphasizes the ordering of the artist’s raw materials into significant, if unrealistic, designs.

人造通常仅指作品，暗示缺乏自发性和自然性。它的语气比做作更负面。后者可能暗示有价值的人造内容已被不必要的风格操纵所损害。另一方面，风格化暗示缺乏内容，而自命不凡的风格正努力掩盖这种内容。风格化与做作和人造一样，都强调风格而不是内容，但它与它们形成对比，语气从中性到赞同；歌舞伎舞蹈的风格化模式。它强调将艺术家的原材料排序成有意义的（尽管不切实际）设计。

Precious is the most negative in tone of any word here and is the most widespread in range, applying to the work, the artist, or to some one who is not artistic in any way. It points to a taste for the genteel and over-elegant, especially when these qualities are as far removed as possible from reality or normality. It suggests a complaisant attempt to be different and striking, and typically results in overstylized affectation ?"slick" in the worst sense of the word: a precious writer of the late 19 th century "Mauve Decade" in English literature; a precious way of speaking.

珍贵是这里所有词语中语气最负面的，也是范围最广的，适用于作品、艺术家或任何不具备艺术天赋的人。它指的是对文雅和过分优雅的品味，尤其是当这些品质与现实或常态相去甚远时。它暗示着一种迎合他人、与众不同和引人注目的尝试，通常会导致过度的矫揉造作。“slick”这个词最糟糕的含义是：19 世纪末英国文学中“紫红色十年”的珍贵作家；一种珍贵的说话方式。

Tasteful and harmonious refer to aesthetic qualities that may be found in artistic works. Tasteful is extremely subjective in referring to what is in accordance with the canons of taste; what is tasteful to one person, such as a pink and purple Christmas tree, might be thought vulgar by another. Harmonious is more objective in pointing to a smooth, well-balanced relation of parts: a harmonious ordering of the room’s spatial relationships. All words in this area are ultimately subjective.

有品位和和谐指的是艺术作品中可能存在的美学品质。有品位非常主观，指的是符合品味标准的东西；对一个人来说有品位的东西，比如一棵粉红色和紫色的圣诞树，在另一个人看来可能很粗俗。和谐更客观，指的是各部分之间关系的流畅、平衡：房间空间关系的和谐排列。这个领域的所有词语最终都是主观的。

4.47 Assert
These verbs all mean to state positively, as though anticipating or countering argument or skepticism. Whereas assert means to state with some force or conviction, allege means to state without offering proof. It was alleged that he was present at the scene of the crime, but he asserted that he was in Europe at the time. Whatever one asserts he would defend in argument, but whether anyone believes something alleged is beside the point; the aim of alleging is to learn the truth by proving or disproving the claim made.

这些动词都表示积极陈述，仿佛在预测或反驳论点或怀疑。assert 表示以某种力量或信念陈述，而 allege 表示不提供证据陈述。据称他在犯罪现场，但他声称当时他在欧洲。无论一个人声称什么，他都会在辩论中为之辩护，但是否有人相信某件被指控的事情并不重要；指控的目的是通过证明或反驳所提出的主张来了解真相。

Affirm means to declare or state positively that something is true; it indicates firm belief or unshakable conviction: to affirm one’s faith in God. Asseverate is nearly synonymous with assert but even more positive; the word is uncommon even in formal writing. Testify means to bear witness, as in a court of law, or declare solemnly to be true: to testify on behalf of the defendant; I can testify to this man’s veracity and good character.

肯定意味着肯定地宣布或陈述某事是真实的；它表示坚定的信念或不可动摇的信念：肯定对上帝的信仰。Asseverate 几乎与 assert 同义，但更为肯定；这个词即使在正式写作中也不常见。Testify 意味着作证，如在法庭上，或庄严地宣布是真实的：代表被告作证；我可以证明这个人的诚实和良好品格。

Maintain, as here considered, means to assert something in the face of evidence or arguments to the contrary: in spite of circumstantial evidence pointing to his guilt, the accused maintained that he was innocent. Maintain almost always involves controversy or disagreement; it presupposes a prior statement to which one is adhering, and in this sense is a reaffirming of one’s position.

此处的坚持，是指在有证据或相反论据的情况下坚持某事：尽管间接证据表明被告有罪，但被告仍坚持自己无罪。坚持几乎总是涉及争议或分歧；它以先前的陈述为前提，并在此意义上重申自己的立场。

Aver means to declare confidently as fact. Avouch means to vouch for or affirm positively. Avow means to declare openly: to avow one’s guilt. None of these words is common in contemporary writing; all occur only in formal writing, and avouch seldom even there.

Aver 表示自信地宣称事实。Avouch 表示肯定地保证或肯定。Avow 表示公开宣称：承认自己的罪行。这些词在当代写作中都不常见；它们都只出现在正式写作中，甚至在正式写作中也很少出现。

	ANTONYMS: CONTRADICT, controvert, demur, dispute, DOUBT, refute.


4.48 Assistant
These words apply to a person who contributes to the accomplishment of a task. Assistant and helper are nearly identical except for the latter’s greater informality. Because of this difference, helper may seem warmer in tone, implying affection, whereas assistant remains coolly objective. [She had to admit that her husband was a good helper around the house; It is not unusual for a woman executive to have a man as her assistant.] Furthermore, one might become someone else’s helper out of generosity, whereas assistant usually implies a paid position within a profession and is sometimes part of an official title: a helper on the cake stall; assistant of the sales manager.

这些词适用于为完成任务做出贡献的人。助理和帮手几乎完全相同，只是后者更加不拘礼节。由于这种差异，帮手的语气可能更温暖，暗示着感情，而助理则保持冷静客观。[她不得不承认她的丈夫是家里的好帮手；女主管找个男助手并不罕见。] 此外，一个人可能出于慷慨而成为别人的帮手，而助理通常意味着职业内的有偿职位，有时是正式头衔的一部分：蛋糕摊的帮手；销售经理的助理。

Subordinate emphasizes the inferiority of a helper or assistant, and its greater formality does not always mitigate an overtone of condescension, sometimes extending even to contempt. [The company sergeant-major treated the lieutenants as though they were merely his subordinates.] subordinate can, however, be neutral in tone, merely describing an unequal relationship: a trusted subordinate. Adjutant and aide are drawn from military life to describe the administrative assistant or subordinate of a superior officer. Aide, because of its brevity, has come to be used for an administrative assistant of considerable prestige who acts on behalf of, or as a personal assistant to a high-ranking superior. Aide is also simply an unqualified assistant or subordinate in the special sense of nurse’s aide.

下属强调助手或助理的低下地位，其较为正式的语气并不总能减轻居高临下的意味，有时甚至会延伸到轻蔑。[连队军士长对待中尉就像他们只是他的下属一样。]然而，下属的语气可以是中性的，仅仅描述一种不平等的关系：值得信赖的下属。副官和助手源自军队生活，用来描述上级军官的行政助理或下属。由于助手一词简短，它被用来指代代表高级上级或作为高级上级私人助理行事的颇具威望的行政助理。助手也可以只是不合格的助手或下属，特别指护士助手。

SEE: ACCOMPLICE, ASSOCIATE.


4.49 Associate
The words in this set refer to professional, business, or work relationships between people. Associate is the least specific of these; its formality would suggest a business or professional context. While it implies close connection, the relationship might be the result of choice, chance or necessity; a man’s business associates. In a more specific use, associate is a component of some professional titles, denoting the second of three ranks: an associate editor; an associate professor. It is also used specifically to indicate less than full membership in a group; A member pays $40 annually in dues, but you can become an associate for $10. In this sense, associate may refer either to a person or to a group within a larger group. Affiliate compares with this use of associate in being now mostly used of a group related to another group: the television affiliate of a city newspaper. It is frequently used to relate a small group to a national or international parent group: the local affiliate of the Royal Life Saving Society. The word suggest that two affiliates are co-equal in a loose relationship of autonomous groups, even when a smaller-to-larger hierarchy is involved. This contrasts with associate in its suggestion of subordinate membership in a group.

这组词语指的是人与人之间的专业、业务或工作关系。Associate 是最不具体的；它的正式性表明了业务或专业背景。虽然它意味着密切联系，但这种关系可能是选择、机会或必要性的结果；一个人的商业伙伴。在更具体的用法中，associate 是一些专业头衔的组成部分，表示三个等级中的第二个：副主编；副教授。它也专门用于表示团体中不完全的成员资格；会员每年需缴纳 40 美元的会费，但只需 10 美元即可成为助理。在这个意义上，associate 可以指一个人或一个更大团体中的团体。与 associate 的这种用法相比，affiliate 现在主要用于指与另一个团体相关的团体：城市报纸的电视分支机构。它经常用于将一个小团体与一个国家或国际母团体联系起来：皇家救生协会的当地分支机构。这个词表明，两个分支机构在松散的自治团体关系中是平等的，即使涉及从小到大的层次结构。这与 associate 形成对比，因为它暗示一个群体中的从属成员身份。

Ally and partner may apply either to individuals or to groups. Ally always suggests a relationship of choice. One’s allies unite with one in a common cause and most often against a common enemy. Allies are not necessarily friends outside the cause that jointly concerns them: The two members were enemies on questions of domestic affairs, but allies on foreign policy. Ally is chiefly used in reference to nations that are on the same side in an international war: England and Russia were allies in World War II. Partner, like ally, may apply to one nation joined with another in a common cause: France and England were partners in an atomic power project. But partner often indicates a close or contractual relationship. It is the legal term for one of he co-owners of a business: He was made a partner in the firm. And it may also refer to a much more personal association: marriage partners. Unlike the other words in this group, partner sometimes points to a one-to-one relationship involving a couple or a pair: his dancing partner; to draw for partners in playing bridge.

盟友和伙伴既可以用于个人，也可以用于团体。盟友总是暗示一种选择关系。盟友与某人为共同目标而团结在一起，而且往往对抗共同的敌人。盟友不一定是共同关心的事业之外的朋友：这两个成员在国内事务上是敌人，但在外交政策上是盟友。盟友主要用于指国际战争中站在同一边的国家：英国和俄罗斯在第二次世界大战中是盟友。伙伴与盟友一样，可以用于指一个国家与另一个国家为共同目标而团结在一起：法国和英国是原子能项目的合作伙伴。但伙伴通常表示密切或合同关系。这是指企业共同所有者之一的法律术语：他被任命为公司的合伙人。它也可能指更个人化的关系：婚姻伴侣。与本组中的其他词不同，伙伴有时指涉及一对或一对夫妇的一对一关系：他的舞伴；在打桥牌时抽签寻找搭档。

The remaining words refer exclusively to person-to-person relationships, as does associate in its more general sense. Co-worker is the least formal of these and applies as readily to manual labour as to more highly skilled occupations: his co-workers in the factory; his co-worker on the government’s conservation project. Co-worker is distinctly neutral in tone, implying neither animosity nor the cordiality that may be suggested by associate. Colleague is restricted almost solely in use to professional association. It is formal in tone, but may range in feeling from neutrality to an expression of respect or approbation: my colleagues in the philosophy department. Fellow, as here considered, is now seldom used except as a title or component. In an academic context, it may mean a graduate student on a fellowship grant, but it may also be used of certain faculty positions: a Fulbright fellow at Auckland University; a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.

其余词语专指人与人之间的关系，associate 的更一般含义也是如此。Co-worker 是这些词语中最不正式的，既适用于体力劳动，也适用于技术含量更高的职业：工厂里的同事；政府保护项目中的同事。Co-worker 的语气明显是中性的，既不暗示敌意，也不暗示 associate 所暗示的诚恳。Colleague 几乎仅限于在专业交往中使用。它的语气很正式，但感觉范围从中性到表示尊重或赞许：哲学系的同事。Fellow，正如这里所考虑的，现在很少使用，除非作为头衔或组成部分。在学术背景下，它可能指获得奖学金的研究生，但也可能用于某些教职：奥克兰大学的富布赖特研究员；牛津大学万灵学院的研究员。

4.50 Assure
These words mean to make or attempt to make something certain or secure by removing doubt. Assure can mean either to make certain or to cause to feel certain. [The doctor assured him that his child would recover from the illness; The fact that the hospital had a good reputation assured him that his child would be well taken care of.]Ensure, or, as it is also spelt, insure, means to make certain as the consequence of some action or agent: To ensure the child’s quick recovery, the doctor gave him an antibiotic. Ensure also means to make safe, to protect against harm; to ensure freedom against tyranny.

这些词的意思是，通过消除疑虑，使某事确定或安全。Assure 既可以表示确定，也可以表示使人感到确定。[医生向他保证，他的孩子会从疾病中康复；这家医院声誉良好，这让他确信他的孩子会得到很好的照顾。]Ensure，或拼写为 insure，表示通过某种行动或因素确定：为了确保孩子早日康复，医生给他开了抗生素。Ensure 还表示确保安全，防止伤害；确保自由不受暴政侵害。

Guarantee means to assume responsibility for the quality of a product or for the performance of a service or obligation. One who guarantees a debt assures the creditor that he will be paid.

担保是指对产品质量或服务或义务的履行承担责任。担保债务的人向债权人保证他将得到偿付。

Promise, like assure, is often designed to make someone feel certain, but hardly guarantees that the outcome will measure up to one’s expectation. Promise implies intention, not obligation, and every child knows that not all promises are kept: to promise someone a rise in pay; to promise to keep an appointment. In another sense, promise simply indicates grounds for favourable expectation. An invalid’s renewed appetite may be deemed a promising sign.

承诺，就像保证一样，通常旨在使某人感到确定，但几乎不能保证结果会符合某人的期望。承诺意味着意图，而不是义务，每个孩子都知道并非所有的承诺都会兑现：承诺某人加薪；承诺遵守约定。从另一个意义上讲，承诺只是表明有利期望的理由。病人恢复食欲可能被视为一个好兆头。

4.51 Attack	
These words all mean to set upon violently or to do battle with. Attack, the most general term of this group, may be applied to any offensive action, but more narrowly means to begin hostilities: to attack an enemy encampment; The watchdog attacked a would-be burglar and drove him off. Attack, like all these words, is also used figuratively: The committee-man attacked the views of a colleague.

这些词都表示猛烈攻击或与之战斗。攻击是这组词中最通用的术语，可用于任何进攻行为，但更狭义的意思是开始敌对行为：攻击敌人的营地；看门狗袭击了一名潜在的入室盗窃者并将其赶走。攻击与所有这些词一样，也用于比喻：委员会成员攻击同事的观点。

Assail and assault have the same etymological origins but differ in meaning. Assail means to attack violently and repeatedly, implying that victory depends not so much on the force or effectiveness of one’s attack but on one’s persistence and pertinacity. To be assailed is to be worn down, to have no respite: a man assailed by doubts. Assault typically suggests close physical contact and extreme violence, especially against one or a few people. Assault may be used as a euphemism for rape. [They were assaulted by a gang of hoodlums not two streets from their home; The noise of car horns, jet planes, jackhammers, ambulance sirens, fire engines, trains, trams and helicopters assaults the ears of city dwellers.]

Assail 和 assault 的词源相同，但含义不同。Assail 的意思是猛烈地、反复地攻击，这意味着胜利并不取决于攻击的力量或有效性，而是取决于一个人的坚持和毅力。To be assailed 是被击垮，没有喘息的机会：一个被怀疑所困扰的人。Assault 通常意味着亲密的身体接触和极端暴力，尤其是针对一个人或几个人。Assault 可以用作强奸的委婉说法。[他们被一帮离家不到两条街的流氓袭击；汽车喇叭、喷气式飞机、风镐、救护车警报器、消防车、火车、电车和直升机的噪音侵扰着城市居民的耳朵。]

Charge and storm both suggest a forceful assault on a fixed position. To charge is to make a violent onslaught or attack upon an enemy: The cavalry charged the hostile fort. But charge in this sense is most often used imperatively as a command. Storm means to take or try to take by force, with all the rush and fury of a storm: Seasoned veterans were picked to storm the difficult enemy position. Storm often conveys a feeling of desperation, an all-out effort to avert defeat and disaster.

冲锋和风暴都表示对固定阵地进行强力攻击。冲锋是对敌人进行猛烈的攻击或袭击：骑兵冲向敌方堡垒。但这种意义上的冲锋最常用作命令。风暴意味着以风暴般的速度和狂暴夺取或试图用武力夺取：经验丰富的老兵被挑选出来猛攻敌人的艰难阵地。风暴常常传达出一种绝望的感觉，一种为了避免失败和灾难而全力以赴的努力。

Besiege means to surround or beset with an armed force in order to capture: to besiege a fortified city. In its figurative uses it is close to assail, but retains some of its basic sense of being hemmed in or enclosed rather than punished repeatedly: Besieged with fears, he decided to seek the aid of a psychiatrist.

围攻的意思是，用武装力量包围或围攻以夺取：围攻一座坚固的城市。在比喻用法中，它接近于攻击，但保留了一些基本含义，即被包围或封闭，而不是反复受到惩罚：他被恐惧所包围，决定寻求精神科医生的帮助。

Bombard means to assail with missiles, or, in figurative senses, with abusive words. [The TV station was bombarded with complaints against a tasteless programme; A prominent clergyman assailed the executives who had permitted it to be shown, and in Parliament an Opposition member attacked the Government’s laxity in enforcing the broadcasting regulations.]

轰炸的意思是使用导弹进行攻击，或者，在比喻意义上，使用辱骂性的言语进行攻击。[电视台因一档低俗的节目而遭到大量投诉；一位著名牧师抨击允许播放该节目的管理人员，议会中，一位反对党成员抨击政府在执行广播法规方面松懈。]

4.52 Attainment
These words, as here considered, refer to a capability resulting, at least in part, from conscious effort. All are frequently used in the plural. Attainment is the loftiest term. It implies a fully developed talent which leads to eminence in the arts, in science or in some comparable field of endeavour: Bertrand Russell is not only a distinguished philosopher but also a man of high literary attainments. Accomplishment, in this sense, refers to any ability or manner acquired from practice or experience; specifically, accomplishments are social graces meant to please or entertain. [In the 19 th century, a young woman of many accomplishments might sing, play the piano and paint; Skill in dancing and the ability to make small talk are accomplishments considered desirable by most adolescents.]

这些词，正如这里所考虑的，是指至少部分地通过有意识的努力而产生的能力。所有这些词都经常以复数形式使用。成就是最崇高的术语。它意味着充分发展的才能，使人在艺术、科学或某些类似的领域中取得杰出成就：伯特兰·罗素不仅是一位杰出的哲学家，而且还是一位具有很高文学造诣的人。从这个意义上讲，成就是​​指从实践或经验中获得的任何能力或举止；具体而言，成就是旨在取悦或娱乐的社交风度。[在 19 世纪，一个多才多艺的年轻女性可能会唱歌、弹钢琴和画画；舞蹈技巧和闲聊能力是大多数青少年认为可取的成就。]

An acquirement is a skill gained by study or practice rather than through natural talent. Where accomplishments may be showy and impressive, acquirements are substantial and useful: The ability to read Sanskrit is an acquirement rarely found even among scholars. Acquisition usually refers to a newly obtained material possession, especially one of intrinsic its rare-book acquisitions. Acquisition may also apply to the attainment of a quality, skill or body of knowledge that is valuable in itself: Self-discipline is an invaluable acquisition.

学识是一种通过学习或实践而非天赋获得的技能。成就可能炫耀而令人印象深刻，而学识则是实质性的和有用的：阅读梵文的能力甚至在学者中也很少见。学识通常指新获得的物质财富，尤其是其内在的珍本财富。学识也可以指获得本身就很有价值的品质、技能或知识体系：自律是一种无价的学识。

4.53 Attraction
Attraction refers to the power or quality that draws a person to another person, an idea or a thing. An affinity is a natural or instinctive attraction or inclination: an affinity among children of the same age. Attraction means the power to attract. If a woman has an attraction for a man, he is attracted or has an affinity for her; nothing is implied about the woman’s feelings towards the man. Affinity is also used to refer to any individual preference or liking that is presumed to be deep-seated or stem from one’s nature or background: an affinity for Italian files; an affinity for mystery novels.

吸引力是指将一个人吸引到另一个人、一个想法或一件事上的力量或品质。亲和力是一种自然或本能的吸引力或倾向：同龄儿童之间的亲和力。吸引力是指吸引的力量。如果一个女人对一个男人有吸引力，那么这个男人也会被她吸引或对她有亲和力；女人对这个男人的感情没有任何暗示。亲和力也用于指任何个人偏好或喜好，这种偏好或喜好被认为是根深蒂固的或源于一个人的天性或背景：对意大利档案的亲和力；对侦探小说的亲和力。

Sympathy, as here considered, refers to an agreement of affections, inclinations or temperaments that makes people agreeable to one another. Two people are in sympathy if they have like affinities ?for example, if they share the same tastes in art, recreation or food.

同情，在这里指的是情感、爱好或性情的一致，使人们彼此和睦相处。如果两个人有相同的爱好，例如，如果他们在艺术、娱乐或食物方面有相同的品味，那么他们就是同情的。

4.54 Attribute	
Attribute means to consider one thing as belonging to or stemming from something else. [Some scientists attribute intelligence to ants; others say that the complex organizational life of ants should be attributed to instinct.]

属性是指将某事物视为属于或源于其他事物。[一些科学家认为蚂蚁具有智慧；另一些人认为蚂蚁复杂的组织生活应归因于本能。]

Ascribe means to assign or attribute a cause, quality, source, etc., to something as a property or as being characteristic of it: to ascribe good (or bad) motives to someone; to ascribe an unsigned painting to Picasso; to ascribe an artifact to the Paleolithic era.

归因意味着将原因、性质、来源等分配或归因于某物作为其属性或特征：将好的（或坏的）动机归因于某人；将一幅未签名的画作归因于毕加索；将一件文物归因于旧石器时代。

Credit, as here considered, means to attribute or ascribe in a favourable sense: to credit a scientist with a major discovery; to credit a seemingly trivial skirmish with being the turning point of a war.

这里所指的功劳，是指以有利的意义归因或归功于：将重大发现归功于一位科学家；将一场看似微不足道的小冲突归功于战争的转折点。

Impute means to attribute a fault, crime, etc., to a person: to impute nepotism to the manager because of his decision to give a highly paid executive position to his brother-in-law. Impute, however, is not invariably associated with derogatory contexts. It may also be used to mean simply to consider as the source or cause of: to impute one’s happiness to modest ambitions.

归咎是指将过错、罪行等归咎于某人：将裙带关系归咎于经理，因为他决定将高薪高管职位交给他的妹夫。然而，归咎并不总是与贬义语境有关。它也可以简单地用来表示认为是……的来源或原因：将一个人的幸福归咎于适度的野心。

4.55 Authoritarian
autocratic
despotic
dictatorial
fascist
oligarchic
paternalistic
plutocratic
totalitarian
tyrannical

These words refer to the wielding of power by a single person or a small group of people, usually without the consent of the governed. Authoritarian, the most general of these, is also the most objectively descriptive and least disapproving in tone, although any of these words will have negative implications for the citizens of a democracy. Authoritarian may describe any form of rule ?from a monarchy to a democracy ?in which unquestioning obedience to those in power is expected or demanded: the military junta that instituted such authoritarian measures as censorship of the press; children whose upbringing was neither permissive nor authoritarian. Paternalistic refers to an authoritarian tendency that sees a populace as childlike and unable to govern itself. The word may suggest either benevolent rule or a style of government determined to keep the governed helpless and dependent: the paternalistic stance of most banana republics; the paternalistic attitude of some university authorities towards their students. Oligarchic refers to the rule of an elite, but does not suggest what grounds are used to determine who is a member of this ruling group: the oligarchic power of the English nobility before the rise of the monarchy. Plutocratic suggests an oligarchic rule based specifically on wealth: the emergence of the first plutocratic industrial giants of the 19 th century.

这些词语指的是一个人或一小群人通常不经被统治者同意而行使权力。其中最普遍的是威权主义，也是最客观的描述性词语，语气中反感的最少，尽管这些词语中的任何一个都会对民主国家的公民产生负面影响。威权主义可以描述任何形式的统治——从君主制到民主制——在这些统治下，人们期望或要求对当权者绝对服从：制定新闻审查等威权措施的军政府；成长环境既不放纵也不威权的孩子。家长式指的是一种威权主义倾向，认为民众像孩子一样，无法自我管理。这个词可能暗示仁慈的统治，也可能暗示一种决心让被统治者无助和依赖的政府风格：大多数香蕉共和国的家长式立场；一些大学当局对学生的家长式态度。寡头统治指的是精英统治，但并未表明以何种依据来确定谁是这一统治集团的成员：君主制兴起前英国贵族的寡头权力。财阀统治则表明一种专门基于财富的寡头统治：19 世纪第一批财阀工业巨头的出现。

The remaining words are all much harsher in tone than the foregoing. Of these, autocratic is the mildest, though stronger than authoritarian. It suggests the absolute rule of a single person, but such a rule may be as repressive or benevolent as the person chooses: autocratic rulers as different as Queen Elizabeth I and Louis XIV; the rare husband who still insists on autocratic control over his family.

其余的词都比前面的词语气严厉得多。其中，独裁是最温和的，但比权威主义强。它暗示一个人的绝对统治，但这种统治可能是压制性的，也可能是仁慈的，这取决于个人的选择：独裁统治者可以像伊丽莎白一世女王和路易十四一样不同；罕见的丈夫仍然坚持对家庭进行专制控制。

Totalitarian is perhaps the least exact of these words in its implications. It suggests the concentration of power in the hands of the few; it also suggests the context of a modern collectivist state. A totalitarian government is certainly authoritarian, but may or may not be oligarchic, plutocratic, paternalistic or autocratic. Such a state would certainly suppress civil liberties, but might still have a benevolent notion, however, misguided, if its duties to the people. On the other hand, it might be based exclusively on the self-aggrandisement and greed of a ruling class: the Puritans of the New World who, out ofself-defence, constructed what amounted to a totalitarian state; a Stalinist regime that was more totalitarian than those that preceded or followed it.

极权主义也许是这些词语中含义最不确切的。它意味着权力集中在少数人手中；它也意味着现代集体主义国家的背景。极权主义政府当然是独裁的，但可能是也可能不是寡头政治、财阀政治、家长制或独裁政治。这样的国家肯定会压制公民自由，但它可能仍然有一种仁慈的观念，然而，如果它对人民尽职尽责，那就被误导了。另一方面，它可能完全建立在统治阶级的自我扩张和贪婪之上：新世界的清教徒出于自卫，建立了一个相当于极权主义的国家；一个比之前或之后的斯大林主义政权更极权的政权。

Dictatorial and tyrannical both may be simply descriptive of autocratic rule, but more often suggest strong disapproval for repressive tactics. Dictatorial, at its most neutral, specifically refers to leaders other than hereditary rulers such as kings. At its most negative, it suggests repressive harshness: Cromwell, who was less dictatorial than many kings; family life embittered by her dictatorial maternalism; companies no longer dictatorial towards their employees. Tyrannical may once have been most appropriate to describe the power of a king, but now it applies more generally to any arbitrary, almost whimsical one-men rule: the tyrannical head of the Parliamentary committee; his tyrannical outburst against his son’s disobedience.
	
独裁和暴虐都可能只是描述独裁统治，但更多时候暗示着对镇压手段的强烈反对。独裁最中性的含义是，专门指除国王等世袭统治者以外的领导人。最负面的含义是，它暗示着镇压的严酷：克伦威尔不像许多国王那样独裁；她的独裁母性使家庭生活苦不堪言；公司不再对员工独裁。暴虐曾经最适合用来描述国王的权力，但现在它更普遍地适用于任何专制、几乎异想天开的一人统治：议会委员会的暴虐领袖；他对儿子不服从的暴虐爆发。

Fascist (also fascistic) and despotic are the most harshly negative of all these words. Fascist in its narrowest sense applies to a strongly nationalistic and militaristic right-wing regime that suppresses civil liberties and attacks selected minorities: the fascist tendencies of many anti-Semites. The word, however, is often used loosely as pure invective for any authoritarian stand: fascist gangsters who took control of the neighbourhood. Despotic could once be applied less negatively to any absolute, autocratic rule, but now it would be more often understood as indicating a fiercely cruel and savagely repressive ruler or government: the rapidly disappearing despotic family head; a government so despotic that citizens could be shot without a trial.

法西斯主义（也称法西斯主义）和专制主义是所有这些词中最严厉的负面词。法西斯主义在其最狭义上适用于压制公民自由和攻击特定少数群体的强烈民族主义和军国主义右翼政权：许多反犹主义者的法西斯主义倾向。然而，这个词经常被随意用作对任何独裁立场的纯粹谩骂：控制社区的法西斯匪徒。专制主义曾经可以不那么负面地用于任何绝对的专制统治，但现在它更多地被理解为指代一个极其残酷和野蛮镇压的统治者或政府：迅速消失的专制家族首领；一个专制到公民可以不经审判就被枪杀的政府。

4.56 Auxiliary
Auxiliary, like the rest of these words, refers to something that gives additional help or support. The help given is usually similar to but less important than the main effort being made: The auxiliary units are called in only when the main force has been overtaxed. Sometimes the word can refer simply to additional or supplementary resources: an oil firm with auxiliary investments in shipbuilding and car parts. Sometimes the word seems to be used almost euphemistically to avoid any suggestion of subordination or inferiority to the main item: the ladies auxiliary committee.
	
辅助，像这些词的其他部分一样，指的是提供额外帮助或支持的事物。所提供的帮助通常与主要努力类似，但重要性较低：辅助单位只有在主力部队负担过重时才会被召集。有时，这个词可以简单地指额外或补充资源：一家在造船和汽车零部件方面有辅助投资的石油公司。有时，这个词似乎被几乎委婉地使用，以避免暗示其从属于或低于主要项目：女士辅助委员会。

Like auxiliary, ancillary may refer to something useful that may or may not be called into action. The ancillary item, however, may be dissimilar though closely related to what it supports: psychology as ancillary to the study of literature. In other instances, ancillary, more than any of the other words, may suggest a dependence of the main thing on the ancillary thing, almost as if the latter were its prerequisite, or preceded it in time: Counterpoint and harmony are certainly ancillary to serious composition.

和辅助词一样，辅助词也可能指有用的东西，可能会或可能不会被用到。然而，辅助词可能与它所支持的东西不同，但关系密切：心理学是文学研究的辅助。在其他情况下，辅助词可能比任何其他词都更能暗示主要事物对辅助事物的依赖，就好像后者是其先决条件，或者在时间上先于它：对位和和声肯定是严肃作品的辅助。

Contributory suggests a definite cause-and-effect relationship unique among these words, indicating one of several factors that result in a particular effect. The contributory cause, however, only accompanies a major cause: Underground sabotage was a contributory factor in the German retreat before the Allied onslaught. Unlike ancillary or auxiliary items, something that is contributory exists only if actually called into action; it cannot be held in abeyance and still be contributory. Also, a contributory factor may be part of destructive as well as a constructive result: Cigarette smoking may be regarded as a contributory cause of cancer in his case.

有助益性表明这些词语中存在着一种独特的明确因果关系，表示导致特定结果的若干因素之一。然而，有助益性原因只伴随主要原因：地下破坏是德军在盟军猛攻前撤退的一个助益性因素。与辅助或辅助项目不同，有助益性的东西只有在实际投入行动时才会存在；它不能被搁置，但仍然是有助益性的。此外，助益性因素可能是破坏性结果的一部分，也可能是建设性结果的一部分：在他的案例中，吸烟可能被视为导致癌症的一个助益性原因。

Secondary and subsidiary both clearly state the subordination or inferiority of the added factor. Secondary relates to contributory in having a cause-and-effect meaning, but unlike contributory, can refer to both causes and effects. A contributory cause, for example, may result only in a secondary effect. Secondary may be applied in any context where comparison is made between primary values, goals, benefits and less important or gratuitous ones. In this respect, subsidiary is more specific, meaning all the attached ramifications that may exist together with a primary situation: an author’s subsidiary rights in the stage and film versions of his novel; a main store’s subsidiary branches. Subsidiary, in this sense, is most like auxiliary in suggesting a similar but less important aspect of a larger whole.

因素。次要的与贡献的有关，具有因果关系的意义，但与贡献的不同的是，它可以指原因和结果。例如，贡献原因可能只会导致次要的影响。次要的可以应用于任何比较主要价值、目标、利益与不太重要或无偿的价值、目标、利益的语境中。在这方面，附属的更具体，意思是可能与主要情况同时存在的所有附加后果：作者对其小说的舞台版和电影版的附属权利；总店的附属分店。从这个意义上讲，附属最像辅助，因为它暗示着更大整体中类似但不太重要的方面。

4.57 Avoid
Avoid means to keep away from or keep at a distance, either by design or as the automatic or accidental consequence of an action. [He drove home over the bridge to avoid the traffic congestion at the sports ground; By driving home over the bridge he unknowingly avoided the sports-ground congestion.]

避开意味着远离或保持距离，可以是有意为之，也可以是某个动作自动或意外的结果。[他开车过桥回家，以避开运动场的交通拥堵；他开车过桥回家，不知不觉地避开了运动场的交通拥堵。]

Escape in its basic sense refers similarly to a deliberate or accidental keeping clear of something. A criminal may adopt a ruse to escape. Detection, or he may escape apprehension by the death of the only witness. Escape is also used with the sense of to manage to avoid, or to remain untouched or uninfluenced by something evil or harmful: to escape being injured by the falling debris.

逃脱的基本含义同样是指故意或无意地避开某物。罪犯可能会采用诡计逃脱。他可能会被发现，或者他可能会利用唯一目击者的死亡来逃脱逮捕。逃脱也指设法避免或保持不受邪恶或有害事物的影响：避免被落下的碎片砸伤。

To elude is to avoid or escape by the use of dexterity or artifice. A half-back may elude tacklers by a side-step; a fugitive may elude pursuers by planting false clues. Evade may sometimes be used in place of elude, but often carries the connotation of avoidance of duty or obligation by underhanded methods: a taxpayer who evaded taxes by falsifying his accounts ?a punishable offence ?although he might legally have avoided a portion of the tax by taking advantage of allowable deductions; a soldier who evades hazardous duty by malingering.

逃避是指利用灵巧或诡计来躲避或逃脱。后卫可以通过侧身躲避拦截者；逃犯可以通过设置假线索来躲避追捕者。逃避有时可以代替逃避，但通常带有通过卑鄙手段逃避责任​​或义务的含义：纳税人通过伪造账目来逃税——这是一种应受惩罚的罪行——尽管他可以利用允许的扣除额合法地逃避部分税款；士兵通过装病逃避危险任务。

Shun and eschew are to avoid with repugnance or distaste, or for reasons of morality or prudence. [A virtuous man will shun evil companions and practices; A man on a diet may shun or eschew rich foods.] Eschew is restricted to formal contexts, and is narrower in application than shun. Whereas eschew points to abstention, shun may indicate either abstention or physical withdrawal; one can shun people as well as thing. [During his illness he shunned all society, and in particular those who had been his dearest friends.]

避和避开是指因厌恶或厌恶而避免，或出于道德或谨慎的原因。[有德之人会避开邪恶的伙伴和行为；节食的人可能会避开或避开油腻的食物。] 避开仅限于正式语境，其应用范围比避开更窄。避开表示禁欲，而避开可以表示禁欲或身体上的退缩；一个人可以避开人和事物。[在他生病期间，他避开了所有社交，尤其是那些曾经是他最亲密的朋友。]

4.58 Award
These words involve the showing of favour either out of generosity or out of respect from achievement. Award and prize are now nearly identical in meaning, although prize is less formal in tone. Both refer to a tribute given for some outstanding accomplishment. Both may or may not imply the giving of sum of money. [The Olympic winner received a gold medal as an award; An award of two thousand dollars accompanied the prize for the best novel of the year.] Prize may also signify the objective or attainment of a struggle. [The company took the hill after an all-night battle, but it was a costly prize; Although he had not guessed it when he proposed, his wife turned out to be quite a prize.]

这些词涉及出于慷慨或对成就的尊重而表示的恩惠。Award 和 prize 现在含义几乎相同，尽管 prize 的语气不那么正式。两者都指对某些杰出成就的赞扬。两者都可能暗示或不暗示给予金钱。[奥运会冠军获得了一枚金牌作为奖励；年度最佳小说奖附带两千美元的奖励。] Prize 也可能表示奋斗的目标或成果。[经过一整夜的战斗，公司占领了这座山，但这是一个昂贵的奖品；虽然他求婚时没有猜到，但他的妻子原来是一个相当大的奖品。]

Honour is more general than the foregoing. Whereas award and prize may suggest an official ceremony of recognition, honour may share this implication or depart from it to indicate simply private, unofficial respect. [The visiting head of state was given the honour of a twenty-one gun salute; it is an honour to hear you speak so highly of me.]

荣誉比上述内容更为普遍。虽然奖项和奖品可能暗示着官方的表彰仪式，但荣誉可能具有同样的意义，也可能与之不同，只是表示私人的、非官方的尊重。[来访的国家元首获得了 21 响礼炮的荣誉；听到你们对我如此高度评价，我深感荣幸。]

Premium is most specific in meaning, referring to an additional value beyond an agreed-on sum, the premium being given when a further condition has been met: The gave him a premium for selling the most insurance that month. More generally, the word may simply mean a high valuation, like honour: I put a high premium on the truth.

Premium 的含义最为具体，指的是超出约定金额的额外价值，只有在满足进一步条件时才会给予保费：The 因他当月销售的保险最多而给予保费。更一般地，这个词可能仅仅意味着高估价，如荣誉：我对真相给予了很高的评价。

Bounty may mean generosity in general, or the gift given as a favour, a rather formal use: The land’s bounty passed all expectation. Bounty is also used specifically to mean a sum of money given by a government for killing a predatory animal: the bounty offered for killing a dingo or, in New Zealand, a wild pig.

Bounty 可能表示一般意义上的慷慨，或作为恩惠而给予的礼物，这是一种相当正式的用法：这片土地的赏金超出了所有人的预期。Bounty 也专门用于表示政府为杀死食肉动物而提供的一笔钱：杀死一只澳洲野狗或新西兰的野猪而提供的赏金。

4.59 Aware
These words mean to have knowledge of the existence or fact of something. Aware is the broadest term, and may mean having knowledge of something in side oneself or of some external fact or condition. Such knowledge may be based on the evidence of one’s senses or on the intellect: to be aware of hunger pangs; aware of a sharp drop in temperature; aware of a new trend in public opinion.

这些词的意思是知道某事物的存在或事实。“意识到”是最宽泛的术语，可能意味着知道自己内心的某事或某些外部事实或情况。这种知识可能基于一个人的感官证据或智力：意识到饥饿感；意识到气温急剧下降；意识到舆论的新趋势。

Conscious at its most restricted is close to aware in indicating the mind’s registering of a sensation, perception or state of affairs: conscious of how dim the room had grown as the twilight deepened; conscious of what the other students thought of her. Even on this level, however, the word may suggest the minimal registering of perception, whereas aware more often implies a keener response or greater alertness that may encompass evaluation or rational judgement: People had been conscious of the problem before, but the new book made them aware of its magnitude. Conscious, furthermore, can apply as aware cannot to the waking state in general, as opposed to a sleeping or comatose state: a local anaesthetic under which a person remains conscious throughout the operation. In a psychological context, the word can apply to those contents of the psyche that are present or available to the ego: a conscious hatred of his mother; slowly becoming conscious of his long-buried feeling of inferiority. Less technically, the word can refer to a deliberate or voluntary judgement: urged to make a conscious choice before events decided the question for them.

最严格的意义上，有意识的意思是大脑对感觉、知觉或事态的记录，它与有意识的很接近：意识到随着暮色渐深，房间变得多么昏暗；意识到其他学生对她的看法。然而，即使在这个层面上，这个词也可能暗示对知觉的最低限度的记录，而有意识的更多时候意味着更敏锐的反应或更高的警觉性，可能包括评价或理性判断：人们以前就意识到了这个问题，但这本新书让他们意识到了它的严重性。此外，有意识可以适用于一般的清醒状态，而不是睡眠或昏迷状态：局部麻醉下，人在整个手术过程中保持清醒。在心理学背景下，这个词可以适用于那些存在或自我可用的心理内容：对母亲有意识的仇恨；慢慢意识到自己长期埋藏的自卑感。从不太专业的意义上讲，这个词可以指深思熟虑或自愿的判断：在事件决定问题之前被迫做出有意识的选择。

Cognizant implies knowledge of a more public character than the other words here considered. To say that one was cognizant of a breeze would be absurdly pretentious, but one may without fear of ridicule claim to be cognizant of new methods in the teaching of foreign languages. [A union leader ought to be cognizant of the attitudes and opinions of the rank and file.] Cognizant thus suggests a deliberate effort to know, and the things known are usually of some public importance. Mindful, like cognizant a rather formal word, emphasizes the giving of attention more than the acquisition of knowledge. [Because I am always mindful of my own mistakes, I am tolerant of the mistakes of others; Mindful of the strong opinions of his electorate, the member voted against the measure.] On to is a colloquial expression meaning aware of, especially of something involving deception or skulduggery. It usually expresses a good deal of indignation, if not outright hostility. [I’m on to you and your fancy ideas about how I should spend my money; you’re nothing but a crook!]

Cognizant 意味着比这里考虑的其他词语具有更公开性质的知识。说一个人知道一丝风气是荒谬的自命不凡，但一个人可以毫无顾忌地声称自己知道教授外语的新方法。[工会领导人应该了解普通会员的态度和意见。] 因此，Cognizant 暗示有意识地努力去了解，而已知的事物通常具有一定的公共重要性。Mindful 和 cognizant 一样是一个相当正式的词，它强调的是给予关注而不是获得知识。[因为我总是谨记自己的错误，所以我容忍别人的错误；考虑到选民的强烈意见，该成员投票反对该措施。] On to 是一个口语表达，意思是意识到，尤其是意识到涉及欺骗或阴谋的事情。它通常表达了极大的愤慨，如果不是彻底的敌意。 [我知道你和你关于我该如何花钱的奇思妙想；你只不过是个骗子！]

4.60 Backblocks
These words refer to the inner portions of a country, to rural regions, or to those remote from cosmopolitan or urban centres. Backblocks is the most general of these and can apply to any of the three situations listed above; its connotations imply a provincial area that is sparsely settled or unimportant: tourists who visit the country’s principal cities but seldom go into the backblocks.

这些词指的是一个国家的内陆地区、农村地区或远离大都市或城市中心的地区。Backblocks 是最常用的词，可以适用于上述三种情况；其内涵是指人烟稀少或不重要的省级地区：游客会参观该国的主要城市，但很少去偏远地区。

Interior and inland are restricted in reference to the inner portions a country, rural or urban, both words having fewer connotations than the previous one. Inland may suggest the greater remoteness of these two words: the inland of the continent; the interior of the island. Interior can, however, suggest greater inaccessibility: an inland lake; the first expeditions to the interior of Africa. Midlands can also function neutrally, but is used mostly to refer to inland regions of England: the great industrial cities of the midlands. Neither remoteness nor inaccessibility is implied here, although provinciality may be indicated.

Interior 和 inland 仅限于指一个国家（农村或城市）的内部部分，这两个词的含义都比前一个词少。Inland 可能表示这两个词中更偏远的部分：大陆的内陆；岛屿的内部。然而，Interior 可能表示更难到达的部分：内陆湖；第一次前往非洲内部的探险。Midlands 也可以用作中性词，但主要用于指英格兰的内陆地区：Midlands 的大型工业城市。这里既不暗示偏远，也不暗示难到达，尽管可能表明了地方性。

Much more popular and less formal than inland or interior is bush, which is widely used to refer to extensive, unsettled or sparsely settled regions, as well as to an area of bushland anywhere. The idiom go bush can mean to leave a town or city for remoter regions or simply to disappear for a while. Outback is a Australian word, referring generally to the arid or semi-arid areas that constitute the major portion of the continent. Whereas bush can refer to an area not built on, and both bush and backblocks can indicate inland regions not necessarily far removed from centres of population, outback conveys a suggestion of extreme remoteness from civilization: children of the outback, learning their lessons by radio in a "classroom" covering a million square miles; the trackless wastes of the far outback, where only an Aborigine could survive. Sticks is an informal American word pertaining to rural areas or provincial centres that are unsophisticated or backward. It is always somewhat derogatory or disparaging in tone: a hick from the sticks; like so many young men who left the sticks to seek his fortune in the big city. Where it is used in Australia and New Zealand, sticks also has this rural sense but frequently it is part of a disparaging reference to an outer suburb as being "the sticks" or "in the sticks" because it is so far from the city.

比 inland 或 interior 更流行且不太正式的是 bush，它被广泛用于指广阔、未开发或人烟稀少的地区，以及任何地方的丛林地带。成语 go bush 可以表示离开城镇前往偏远地区，或者只是消失一段时间。outback 是一个澳大利亚词，通常指构成澳大利亚大陆大部分的干旱或半干旱地区。bush 可以指没有建筑物的地区，bush 和 backblocks 都可以表示内陆地区，这些地区不一定远离人口中心，而 outback 则传达了与文明极度遥远的暗示：内陆的孩子们在占地一百万平方英里的“教室”里通过收音机学习课程；遥远内陆的荒无人烟的荒原，只有土著人才能生存。Sticks 是一个非正式的美国词，指不成熟或落后的农村地区或省中心。它的语气总是有些贬义或轻蔑：来自 sticks 的乡巴佬；就像许多年轻人离开乡下，到大城市寻求发展一样。在澳大利亚和新西兰，“sticks”也有乡村的意思，但它经常被用来贬义远郊，称其为“the sticks”或“in the sticks”，因为那里离城市太远了。

4.61 Backward
These adjectives are applied to countries, areas or peoples that need to advance economically if they are to compete in the modern world. Backward is a purely negative word, expressing an unfavourable comparison. A backward land is one that lags far behind other nations in its development. Its failure to progress stems from what it lacks ?adequate income, education, industry, technology: the impoverished, illiterate people of a backward mountain region. At best backward is bluntly descriptive. At worst, it is pejorative, implying inferiority as well as ignorance and suggesting a blameworthy lack of initiative. Backward can also refer to persons, usually children, who lack ability compared with their fellows, generally as a result of low intelligence. Primitive, by contrast, simply indicates an early stage in the development of civilization, a stage prior to industrialization. A primitive society has no written language and no advanced technology or system of production. Its economy and material culture are simple and unsophisticated: a primitive land of huntsmen and food gatherers. Primitive may also refer to anything that is crude and simple because it is in a rudimentary stage or form: primitive agriculture.

这些形容词适用于那些需要在经济上取得进步才能在现代世界中竞争的国家、地区或民族。落后是一个纯粹的贬义词，表达了一种不利的对比。落后的国家是指在发展上远远落后于其他国家的国家。它未能进步的原因是它缺乏足够的收入、教育、工业、技术：落后山区的贫困文盲人民。落后在最好的情况下是直截了当的描述。在最坏的情况下，它是贬义的，暗示着自卑和无知，并暗示应受谴责的缺乏主动性。落后也可以指与同龄人相比缺乏能力的人，通常是儿童，通常是由于智力低下。相比之下，原始仅表示文明发展的早期阶段，即工业化之前的阶段。原始社会没有书面语言，也没有先进的技术或生产系统。它的经济和物质文化简单而朴素：一个由猎人和食物采集者组成的原始国家。原始也可能指任何粗糙和简单的事物，因为它处于初级阶段或形式：原始农业。

Depressed designates an area that is economically underprivileged ?a place of unequal opportunity, marked by widespread unemployment and a low standard of living. It implies a contrast with previous or surrounding conditions, often indicating a severe economic decline or a pocket of poverty in a prosperous land: a once-thriving mining region that is now a depressed area full of ghost towns; volunteers teaching preschool children in depressed districts.

贫困地区指的是经济上处于弱势的地区——机会不平等的地方，失业率普遍较高，生活水平低下。它意味着与以前或周围的条件形成鲜明对比，通常表示经济严重衰退或富足土地上的贫困：曾经繁荣的采矿区现在变成了充满鬼城的贫困地区；志愿者在贫困地区教幼儿园的孩子。

Underdeveloped marks a changes in emphasis, focusing on potential. It may be used as a euphemism for backward, since it stresses the presence of untapped resources. Or it may be used in conjunction with backward, describing a land that is backward in some respects or to some degree. [The most backward of the underdeveloped countries are those that have the fewest outside contacts with the modern world.] The fact that a country or region is underdeveloped may be due to insufficient investment capital, technical backwardness, or a deep-rooted resistance to progress and changes. A developing country, by contrast, is committed to progress, trying to catch up with the prosperous nations so as to share in the world’s wealth: technical aid for the developing countries; the developing nations of Africa and Latin America. But a developing country may be subject to growing pains ?the problems arising during a period of rapid growth or change: developing nations that are saddled with heavy debts, their resources taxed by a burgeoning population.

欠发达标志着重点的转变，重点放在潜力上。它可以用作落后的委婉说法，因为它强调存在未开发的资源。或者它可以与落后连用，描述在某些方面或某种程度上落后的土地。[最落后的欠发达国家是那些与现代世界接触最少的国家。]一个国家或地区欠发达可能是由于投资资本不足、技术落后或对进步和变革的根深蒂固的抵制。相比之下，发展中国家致力于进步，试图赶上繁荣的国家，以分享世界财富：为发展中国家提供技术援助；非洲和拉丁美洲的发展中国家。但发展中国家可能会经历成长的烦恼——在快速增长或变革时期出现的问题：发展中国家背负着沉重的债务，其资源被迅速增长的人口所耗尽。

Emerging and emergent are the most positive of all these words. Emerging implies a national self-consciousness that propels a land towards political as well as economic independence. An emerging country is typically moving from the subordinate status of a colony, protectorate, or dependency to the status of a nation among nations: nationalist movements in the emerging countries. Emergent is a more pretentious word than emerging, smacking of bureaucratic jargon. Nevertheless, it has favourable connotations, being applied to newly independent nations that are coming forth to take their place on the international scene: emergent African nations joining the U.N.

新兴和出现是所有这些词中最积极的。新兴意味着一种民族自我意识，推动一个国家走向政治和经济独立。一个新兴国家通常从殖民地、保护国或附属国的从属地位转变为民族中的国家地位：新兴国家的民族主义运动。出现是一个比出现更自命不凡的词，带有官僚主义的行话。尽管如此，它也有积极的含义，适用于正在崛起在国际舞台上占据一席之地的新独立国家：新兴非洲国家加入联合国。

4.62 Bad
These words describe qualities or situations that arouse feelings of displeasure or dislike, but usually not of strong aversion. Bad, the most general word of this group, may be a weak synonym for any of the other terms, indicating an unfavourable or undesirable quality. Bad government usually means corrupt government; a bad typist is an incompetent typist; a bad odour is often a disgusting or offensive odour; a bad child is a troublesome child; a bad situation may be either an unhappy or a dangerous situation.

这些词语描述的是引起不快或厌恶的品质或情况，但通常不会引起强烈的厌恶。坏是该组中最常用的词，可能是其他任何词语的弱同义词，表示不利或不受欢迎的品质。坏政府通常意味着腐败的政府；坏打字员是指不称职的打字员；坏气味通常是令人厌恶或令人不快的气味；坏孩子是指麻烦的孩子；坏情况可能是不幸或危险的情况。

Unpleasant is also a general word, but with a more limited application than bad. Unpleasant simply means not pleasant, failing to please: an unpleasant evening spent listening to a bore. However, unpleasant is often used as is bad to describe things that are displeasing or painful in various degrees of intensity. An unpleasant operation may be a polite description of a painful operation; an unpleasant day may be a polite description of a painful operation; an unpleasant day may be a tiring day or a stormy day; an unpleasant person may be s selfish, quarrelsome or dirty person; an unpleasant taste my be a bitter or rancid taste.

Unpleasant 也是一个通用词，但其应用范围比 bad 更有限。Unpleasant 的意思只是不愉快，不能令人愉快：一个不愉快的夜晚，听着无聊的话。但是，unpleasant 也经常和 bad 一样用来描述不同程度的令人不快或痛苦的事情。unpleasant operation 可能是对痛苦手术的礼貌描述；unpleasant day 可能是对痛苦手术的礼貌描述；unpleasant day 可能是令人疲惫的一天或暴风雨的一天；unpleasant person 可能是自私的、好争吵的或肮脏的人；unpleasant taste 可能是苦味或腐臭的味道。

Disagreeable and distasteful are stronger and more specific terms than bad and unpleasant. That which is disagreeable offends the senses, the feelings or the opinions: the disagreeable taste of sour milk; to find the attentions of an unwanted suitor disagreeable; to find expressions of bigotry not only disagreeable to listen to, but almost impossible to eradicate. That which is distasteful is something which one finds disagreeable or shuns, not because it is inherently bad or undesirable, but because it goes against one'?tastes or nature. [Some people find hard work distasteful; Asking a favour from anyone was distasteful to my mother.] Distasteful is now only rarely applied to food or drink that is poorly prepared or has a disagreeable taste.
	
令人不快和令人厌恶是比坏和令人不快更强烈和更具体的术语。令人不快的事物会冒犯感官、感情或观点：酸牛奶的味道令人不快；不受欢迎的追求者的关注令人不快；偏执的表现不仅令人不快，而且几乎不可能根除。令人厌恶的事物是人们认为不愉快或避开的事物，不是因为它本质上不好或不受欢迎，而是因为它违背了人们的品味或天性。[有些人觉得辛苦工作令人厌恶；对我的母亲来说，向任何人求助都是令人厌恶的。]令人厌恶的事物现在很少用于描述烹饪不当或味道令人不快的食物或饮料。

Objectionable carries strong overtones of disapproval and moral indignation: The censors declared the love scenes in the book to be objectionable. Objectionable may also apply to that which is counter to one’s sense of what is proper, fitting or aesthetically pleasing. [Sentimentality is objectionable to critical, informed lovers of art; The Japanese, with their love of simplicity and order, find cluttered interiors objectionable.]
	
令人反感带有强烈的反对和道德愤慨的意味：审查人员宣布书中的爱情场景令人反感。令人反感也可能适用于与一个人对什么是适当、合适或审美愉悦的感觉相悖的东西。[对于批判性、见多识广的艺术爱好者来说，多愁善感是令人反感的；日本人热爱简单和秩序，认为杂乱的室内空间令人反感。]

4.63 Banel
These words refer to what is offensive to good taste because of its want of sense, significance or freshness. Banal, most strictly, refers to something that is so commonplace that it lacks freshness: jokes, hoary-headed with age. But the word has gathered connotations that go beyond this strict meaning, referring to an odious or deplorable lack of taste: another season of banal television programmes.

这些词指的是那些因为缺乏意义、重要性或新鲜感而有损高雅品味的东西。最严格地说，banal 指的是太过平凡而缺乏新鲜感的东西：笑话，随着时间的流逝而变得陈旧。但这个词已经积累了超越这一严格含义的内涵，指的是令人厌恶或可悲的缺乏品味：又一季平庸的电视节目。

Both insipid and vapid, like the Latin words from which they come can literally refer to foods that lack savour. In applying to what is tasteless or gauche, both words also point to staleness, flatness, or want of spirit. They are often thought to be interchangeable, but subtle differences between them can be felt. Insipid is especially pertinent for describing instances of expression or behaviour suggesting weakness or feebleness; this contrasts it with banal, which suggests outrageous bad taste: choosing between the insipid dullness of a drawing-room comedy and the banal mediocrity of a musical extravaganza. Vapid, on the other hand, might be thought more pertinent to describing a whole personality, one of limited mentality: a vapid starlet who kept making insipid remarks about the weather. Vapid, when it describes behaviour rather than character, often suggests patent insincerity: thanking him with a vapid smile.

insipid 和 vapid 就像它们所源于的拉丁语单词一样，字面意思都是缺乏味道的食物。在用来形容无味或粗俗时，这两个词也指陈腐、平淡或缺乏精神。人们常常认为它们可以互换，但仍然可以感觉到它们之间的细微差别。insipid 尤其适合描述表现出软弱或无力的表情或行为；这与 banal 形成对比，banal 暗示着极其低俗的品味：在客厅喜剧的平淡无味和平庸的音乐盛会之间做出选择。另一方面，vapid 可能被认为更适合描述整个个性，一种心智有限的个性：一个无聊的小明星不停地对天气发表无聊的评论。vapid 在描述行为而不是性格时，常常暗示明显的虚伪：用无聊的微笑感谢他。	
	
Unlike the foregoing, jejune and inane are less concerned with something that has lost its freshness than with something that reveals a total lack of substance to begin with. Jejune derives from a Latin word meaning hungry and applies emphatically to what is worthless and uninteresting. [This play cannot be called banal, considering its novelty, nor insipid, considering its liveliness, nor vapid, considering its sensitivity; nevertheless, it is utterly unstimulating and jejune in every particular.] Inane derives from a word meaning empty and refers to something that is regarded as worthless because it lack sense to the point of becoming foolish or silly: attempts at flattery that would be laughable if they weren’t so inane. Jejune can also suggest an enduring state of mental exhaustion or emptiness: grimly resigning herself to the jejune patterns of suburban living. Because of confusion with jejune, the French word for young, the word is also used disapprovingly to indicate immaturity or naïvetè: jejune teen-age fads. Fatuous is an intensification of inane in that it adds a suggestion of self-contented smugness to the silliness suggested by inane: a fatuous grin that revealed how witty she imagined her inane remark to be.	
	
与上述不同，jejune 和 inane 更关心的是事物失去新鲜感，而不是事物本身就缺乏实质内容。Jejune 源自拉丁语，意为饥饿，着重指毫无价值和无趣的事物。[考虑到它的新颖性，这部剧不能被称为平庸；考虑到它的生动性，也不能被称为乏味；考虑到它的敏感性，也不能被称为枯燥；尽管如此，它在各个方面都极其乏味和幼稚。] Inane 源自一个意为空洞的词，指被认为毫无价值的东西，因为它缺乏意义，变得愚蠢或愚蠢：奉承的企图如果不是那么幼稚，那就太可笑了。Jejune 还可以指持久的精神疲惫或空虚状态：无奈地接受郊区生活的幼稚模式。由于与法语单词 jejune（表示年轻人）相混淆，该词也被用来表示不成熟或幼稚：青少年的幼稚时尚。Fatuous 是 inane 的强化形式，它在 inane 所暗示的愚蠢中增加了一种自鸣得意的自鸣得意：一个愚蠢的笑容表明她想象她的愚蠢言论是多么的诙谐。

4.64 Bar
These words refer to public places in which alcoholic drinks are served. Bar is the general word for that section of a licensed hotel, or a licensed club, in which the serving and drinking of liquor is the primary concern. [Let’s have a drink in the bar before we go into the dining room.] In America the word refers also to the ubiquitous street bar (often small) which is not part of a hotel but which exists solely for the serving and drinking of alcoholic beverages. Saloon has a much more complicated set of meanings. In Australia, as in Britain, the saloon bar in a hotel is separate from the public bar and differs from the latter in that its appointments are superior and the drinks more costly. (A similar distinction between these tow sorts of bars exists in New Zealand hotels, but in this case the better-appointed kind is known as the lounge bar or private bar.) Drawn from the French salon, the word saloon can also indicate the main gathering place of a passenger ship, reflecting its earliest use pertaining to the room in a home where people gathered for conversation. In any case, saloon originally suggested an elegantly appointed place, one both sumptuous and respectable. As such, it was taken over in America to confer respectability on public drinking places, but with the Prohibition era the word lost favour and came to indicate any sordid, low-life bar, a connotation from which the word, in America, has never recovered.	
	
这些词指的是供应酒精饮料的公共场所。Bar 是指有执照的酒店或有执照的俱乐部中主要提供和饮用酒类的区域的统称。[我们先在酒吧喝一杯再去餐厅吧。] 在美国，这个词也指随处可见的街边酒吧（通常很小），它不属于酒店，而仅用于供应和饮用酒精饮料。Saloon 的含义要复杂得多。在澳大利亚和英国，酒店里的沙龙酒吧与公共酒吧是分开的，区别于公共酒吧的是，沙龙酒吧的设施更高级，酒水更贵。 （新西兰酒店也有类似的两种酒吧的区别，但在这种情况下，设备更齐全的酒吧被称为酒廊酒吧或私人酒吧。）saloon 一词源于法语 salon，也可以指客轮的主要聚会场所，反映了其最早的用法，指人们聚集在一起聊天的房间。无论如何，saloon 最初指的是一个装修优雅的地方，既豪华又体面。因此，它在美国被用来指公共饮酒场所的体面，但随着禁酒令时代的到来，这个词失去了吸引力，开始指任何肮脏、下流的酒吧，在美国，这个词从未恢复过这种含义。

Cocktail lounge does indicate the elegant surroundings once suggested by saloon. Typically, such a place might be spacious and well-upholstered; it would offer a menu of food and possibly a singer or pianist for entertainment, though most likely it would not accommodate social dancing. The main function, here, is still that of serving liquor. Nightclub suggests a more lavish setting than cocktail lounge, indicating a place where eating and entertainment are as important as drinking itself. Whereas one could frequent a cocktail lounge in the afternoon or early evening, nightclub specifically indicates late hours; furthermore, the entertainment typically includes social dancing, a band (or "combo") of musicians, often with a singer, and the performances of one or more comedians. The entertainment may be on a far more lavish scale, involving an orchestra, chorus girls, etc.	

鸡尾酒廊确实表明了曾经被沙龙暗示的优雅环境。通常，这样的地方可能很宽敞，装饰精美；它会提供食物菜单，可能还有歌手或钢琴师来娱乐，尽管很可能不会举办社交舞会。这里的主要功能仍然是提供酒水。夜总会比鸡尾酒廊更奢华，表明在那里吃饭和娱乐与喝酒本身一样重要。虽然人们可以在下午或傍晚经常光顾鸡尾酒廊，但夜总会特别表明时间很晚；此外，娱乐活动通常包括社交舞会、乐队（或“组合”）音乐家（通常还有歌手）以及一个或多个喜剧演员的表演。娱乐活动可能规模更大，包括管弦乐队、合唱团女孩等。

Cabaret also indicates a place offering entertainment as well as liquor. It suggests smaller, more intimate surroundings, however, where singing or dancing acts are presented, though social dancing may not be involved. Recently, satirical revues and even serious plays have been presented in cabarets. At its inception, the recent word discothèque referred to a place where the new forms of social dancing were done to recorded music. Now the word is also used of places where modern social dancing is done to live music. Discothèque is the one word here that need not imply the serving of alcoholic drinks, since many of these places cater particularly to teenagers to whom alcohol may not be sold.

Cabaret 也指提供娱乐和酒水的场所。但它指的是规模更小、更私密的环境，在那里有歌舞表演，但可能不涉及交际舞。最近，在 Cabaret 中上演了讽刺性歌舞剧甚至严肃的戏剧。最初，discothèque 一词指的是在录制的音乐下进行新式交际舞的场所。现在，这个词也用于指在现场音乐下进行现代交际舞的场所。Discothèque 是这里唯一一个不必暗示提供酒精饮料的词，因为许多此类场所专门为青少年提供服务，而青少年不得向他们出售酒精饮料。

4.65 Bare
These words mean devoid of clothing or of a usual covering. Bare, when applied to objects, means without covering or ornament: a bare outcropping of rock; a tree bare of leaves. When used of a person, bare usually applies to a part of the body rather than to the entire body: bare knees; bare arms and legs. By extension it is also used to indicate the omission of fancy trappings or non-essential adjuncts: Just give us the bare facts, without embellishment.

这些词的意思是没有衣服或通常的遮盖物。Bare 用于物体时，意思是没有遮盖物或装饰物：裸露的岩石露头；光秃秃的树。用于人时，bare 通常适用于身体的一部分而不是整个身体：裸露的膝盖；裸露的手臂和腿。引申开来，它还用于表示省略华丽的装饰或不必要的附属物：只给我们最基本的事实，不要修饰。

Naked, when applied to a person, means completely devoid of clothing. Naked is often invested with moral or emotional connotations, and may suggest sexual excitation or exhibitionism. [The hotel fire caught them both naked; She couldn’t wear bikinis because the made her feel naked.] In other contexts, naked may suggest purity or innocence or simply be a neutral description: naked nymphs; naked children frolicking in the street; The body was naked when discovered. In the sense of bare, naked is also used about physical objects or forces generally for poetic effect or for emphasis: naked boughs; naked power; the naked truth.

Naked 用来形容人时，意思是完全没有衣服。Naked 常常带有道德或情感含义，可能暗示性兴奋或裸露癖。[酒店大火烧到他们俩都赤身裸体；她不能穿比基尼，因为那会让她感觉赤身裸体。] 在其他情况下，naked 可能暗示纯洁或天真，或者只是中性描述：裸体的仙女；在街上嬉戏的裸体儿童；尸体被发现时是赤裸的。在 bare 的意义上，naked 也用于形容物理对象或力量，通常是为了达到诗意效果或强调：赤裸的树枝；赤裸的力量；赤裸的真相。

Nude applies only to persons and may be neutral in connotation by itself, but its context ?sexual interest being what it is in modern society ?often makes it highly charged with emotional feeling. The noun nude denotes an unclothed figure in painting or sculpture and the association of the word with aesthetic appreciation often invests it with a kind of glamorous appeal lacking in naked. Nude has a more respectable tone than naked; thus fashion writers can advertise some feminine clothing as having a nude look but dare not call it naked. For the same reason one speaks of sleeping in the nude, never naked.

裸体仅适用于人，其本身可能含义中性，但其语境——现代社会的性趣味——往往使其充满情感。名词裸体表示绘画或雕塑中未穿衣服的人物，该词与审美欣赏的联系往往赋予其一种裸体所缺乏的迷人魅力。裸体比裸体更受尊重；因此，时尚作家可以宣传一些女性服装具有裸体外观，但不敢称其为裸体。出于同样的原因，人们会说裸睡，但从不说裸体。

Stripped literally means having been rendered bare, naked, or nude by some outside agency but it is often used figuratively to mean deprived: stripped of his medals for disobeying a commanding officer; stripped of all his privileges pending an official investigation.

“剥光”的字面意思是被一些外部机构弄得赤裸、赤身裸体或赤身裸体，但它通常用来比喻被剥夺：因不服从指挥官而被剥夺勋章；在官方调查期间被剥夺所有特权。

4.66 Barter
These words are alike in referring, most specifically, to a bargaining for goods or services that is conducted without the use of money.

这些词语的含义相似，最具体地说，是指不使用金钱进行的商品或服务的讨价还价。

Barter is the most formal and most specific of these. In the most primitive economic system, one gives the product he has made or grown in return for someone else’s product ?with no intermediary devices to assess abstract value. A farmer, in such a system, might barter several sacks of fodder for a pair of boots made by a shoemaker who happens to need feed for his horse. Barter in this strict definition does not involve middlemen; a person barters only for what he needs and intends to use. If the shoemaker, however, didn’t need fodder at the exact moment of his bargain, he might still take the fodder, planning to trade it with someone else for something he could use. In any but the most primitive societies, of course, bartering as such, except among children, is almost unknown, but many kinds of trading may exist. A person may trade merely for sustenance, as with barter, but more commonly in order to sell what he gets for a profit; trading, thus, can be an occupation or livelihood: a record number of shares traded on the Stock Exchange. In senses other than the economic, barter was fewer uses than trade, and would strike most ears as needlessly formal: diplomats who bartered for peace. Trade, more informal, also has a wider range of general application: trading compliments; trading glances in the crowded bar.

以物易物是其中最正式、最具体的一种。在最原始的经济体系中，一个人用自己制造或种植的产品换取别人的产品——没有中介机构来评估抽象价值。在这样的体系中，农民可能会用几袋饲料来换取鞋匠做的一双靴子，而鞋匠正好需要喂马的饲料。严格意义上的以物易物不需要中间人；一个人只以物易物，交换他需要和打算使用的东西。然而，如果鞋匠在交易时并不需要饲料，他可能仍然会拿走饲料，计划与别人换取他用的东西。当然，在最原始的社会之外，除儿童之间外，以物易物这种行为几乎不为人知，但可能存在多种类型的交易。一个人可能仅仅为了维持生计而进行交易，就像以物易物一样，但更常见的是为了卖掉他得到的东西来赚取利润；因此，交易可以成为一种职业或谋生手段：股票交易所交易的股票数量创下了历史新高。除了经济意义之外，易货贸易的用途比贸易少，而且大多数人会觉得它过于正式：外交官用易货换取和平。贸易更为非正式，也有更广泛的一般应用：互相恭维；在拥挤的酒吧里互相交换眼神。

In bartering and trading, a person must exchange one item for another. Exchanges is not limited to the economic sense applying to any reciprocal giving and receiving. In some uses, the things given and received may be equally valued: exchanging partners at a dance. Or the value may not be an important aspect: exchanging gifts at Christmas; exchanging letter. Perhaps more often, exchange implies the divesting of something unsuitable or unsatisfactory for something better: exchanging jobs; exchanging merchandise damaged in delivery.

在易货和交易中，一个人必须用一件物品交换另一件物品。交换并不局限于任何互惠给予和接受的经济意义。在某些用途中，给予和接受的东西可能具有同等价值：在舞会上交换舞伴。或者价值可能不是一个重要方面：在圣诞节交换礼物；交换信件。也许更常见的是，交换意味着放弃不合适或不令人满意的东西，换取更好的东西：交换工作；交换在运输过程中损坏的商品。

Swap, most specifically, is like barter, except for its extreme informality. [The prospector swapped his gold dust for a jug of whisky; I’ll swap my shanghai for your mouth organ.] In some cases it may enter formal speech or writing when descriptive of a specific phenomenon: The sociologist did research on housewives who swapped husbands at Saturday night parties.

交换，最具体地说，就像易货贸易，只是它非常不正式。[勘探者用他的金粉换了一壶威士忌；我用我的上海琴换你的口琴。] 在某些情况下，当描述特定现象时，它可能进入正式的口语或写作：社会学家对在周六晚上聚会上交换丈夫的家庭主妇进行了研究。


4.67 Basic
These words are concerned with concepts of totality and completeness or of necessity. Basic and fundamental suggest first principles that underlie more complex considerations. Fundamental is the more formal of the two and is more natural in a philosophical context when applied to the principles themselves: a fundamental truth. In an educational context, it strongly suggests something that is indispensable or a pre-requisite to more advanced development: reading as a fundamental skill. While fundamental often points to what is ideally necessary, basic may point to what is actually the case. [Lacking the fundamental ability to make distinctions, their basic vocabulary was greatly reduced.] Basic also has a wider range of application: the basic black of women’s evening dress; a basic distrust of strangers. In these cases, the word may suggest not what in necessary but what is accepted or standard.

这些词与整体性、完整性或必要性概念有关。Basic 和 fundamental 表示支撑更复杂考虑的第一原则。Fundamental 是两者中更正式的一个，在应用于原则本身的哲学语境中更自然：基本真理。在教育语境中，它强烈暗示了某些不可或缺的东西或更高级发展的先决条件：阅读是一项基本技能。fundamental 通常指向理想情况下的必要性，而 basic 可能指向实际情况。[由于缺乏基本的区分能力，他们的基本词汇量大大减少。]Basic 的应用范围也更广：女士晚礼服的基本黑色；对陌生人的基本不信任。在这些情况下，这个词可能不是表示必要性，而是表示被接受的或标准的。

Absolute in one sense is used simply as an intensification of basic: an absolute dislike of women. Absolute, however, relates philosophically to ultimate and categorical in another sense. Here, it refers to totality of power. Where fundamental indicates an initial necessity, absolute suggests final and conclusive authority: The child’s fundamental instinct towards co-operation was over-ruled by the absolute value the tribe placed upon competition. Ultimate also suggests the highest or final authority: the ultimate court of appeal. Unlike absolute, it carries an implication of something worked through in time: What our ultimate view of the universe will be no one can say. Unlimited, while suggesting totality, contrasts with ultimate in relating more often to quantity than to time: unlimited profits. It compares to absolute in suggesting less a highest authority than one to which no opposition exists. [The king’s powers were absolute but hardly unlimited, considering the strictures of canon and common law.] Categorical in its philosophical sense refers to something, usually a principle, which is inescapable, undeniable and universal. Like fundamental, it suggests an ideal necessity; like absolute, it suggests finality and totality. [The categorical imperative of Kant was a moral truth that the structure of the universe made inevitable.]

从某种意义上说，绝对只是用来强化基础：绝对不喜欢女性。然而，绝对在哲学上与终极和绝对相关，在另一种意义上。在这里，它指的是权力的总和。基础表示最初的需要，而绝对则表示最终的和决定性的权威：孩子对合作的基本本能被部落对竞争的绝对价值所压倒。终极也表示最高或最终权威：最终上诉法院。与绝对不同，它暗示着某种随着时间的推移而得到解决的东西：没有人能说我们对宇宙的最终看法是什么。无限虽然暗示了整体，但与终极形成对比，因为它更多地与数量有关而不是与时间有关：无限的利润。它与绝对相比，更多地暗示了不存在反对的权威，而不是最高权威。 [考虑到教规和普通法的严格规定，国王的权力是绝对的，但并非无限的。] 绝对命令在哲学意义上指的是某种不可避免、不可否认和普遍的东西，通常是一种原则。与基本原则一样，它表明了一种理想的必然性；与绝对原则一样，它表明了终结性和整体性。[康德的绝对命令是宇宙结构必然导致的道德真理。]

4.68 Basis
These words all refer to something upon which something else rests or depends. Basis differs from base in being more often used in metaphorical senses: The basis of his argument was that the victory was unattainable without seriously jeopardizing domestic programmes. Base, on the other hand, normally refers to physical objects that form the lowest or supporting part of anything: the base of a statue. It can be used metaphorically as well: the base of a theory. In this sense basis and base are practically synonymous; base, however, more often suggests the idea of an underlying foundation, whereas basis is broader in application and may suggest the idea of a central or fundamental part s well as that of an underlying principle. [Axioms are the base of geometry; The basis of his decision; One what basis do you propose to pay me?]
	
这些词全都指某物依赖或依靠其他物。Basis 与 base 不同，它更多地用于比喻：他的论点的基础是，如果不严重危及国内计划，就无法取得胜利。而 Base 通常指构成任何物体最低部分或支撑部分的实物：雕像的底座。它也可以用作比喻：理论的基础。从这个意义上讲，basis 和 base 实际上是同义词；然而，base 更多地指的是潜在基础的概念，而 basis 的应用范围更广，可能指的是中心或基本部分以及潜在原则的概念。[公理是几何学的基础；他做出决定的基础；你打算付给我什么基础？]

Foundation can mean the base on which something rests: the foundation of a building. Foundation suggests a more imposing, solid structure than base, which can apply to the bottom part of anything: the base of a lamp; the foundation of an ancient city. Foundation also means that on which anything is founded, and in this sense is close to basis: The foundation of democracy is the will of the people to preserve liberty. It should perhaps be noted that foundation is now used commercially to refer to a variety support, such as facial make-up applied beneath other make-up and certain undergarments that hold in vital parts of the body so that outer-garments do not reveal their actual shape.

Foundation 可以表示支撑某物的基座：建筑物的地基。Foundation 比 base 更显眼、更坚固，base 可以用于任何物体的底部：灯座；古城的地基。Foundation 也表示任何事物建立在其上的东西，在这个意义上与 basis 相近：民主的基础是人民维护自由的意愿。也许应该注意的是，foundation 现在在商业上用来指各种支撑物，例如涂抹在其他化妆品下面的面部化妆品和某些内衣，它们可以固定身体的重要部位，使外衣不会暴露其实际形状。

Ground, as here considered, means a foundation or basis for a decision, argument or relationship. It often used in the plural, it may be construed as singular. [The grounds for his decision was never clearly stated; Absenteeism constitutes grounds for dismissal.] Grounds implies the underpinnings of reason: Leverrier’s mathematical computations were the grounds for his theory that there was a planet beyond Uranus.
	
此处所指的“理由”是指决策、论据或关系的基础或依据。它通常以复数形式使用，但也可以理解为单数。[他从未明确说明他做出这一决定的理由；旷工构成解雇的理由。]理由意味着理性的基础：勒维耶的数学计算是他提出天王星之外还有一颗行星的理论的依据。

4.69 Beat
These words refer to physical punishment meted out by means of blows administered primarily by hand or by some instrument held in the hand. Beat is the most general of these end the least specific. It  perhaps most strongly suggests a pummelling with the fists; this may be the result of spur-of-the-moment anger between opponents: ruffians who beat him up after school. But the word can also suggest a more deliberate inflicting of punishment on an inferior by a superior: a psychotic mother who beat her children unmercifully. In these latter cases, some sort of instrument may well be used: beating the dog with a rolled-up newspaper. Thrash is more likely to be restricted to the first situation, expressing spontaneous anger between opponents. Although fisticuffs might be the main element of the attack, the word suggests a general sort of knocking about by any means whatever. Thrash indicates a more thorough or methodical act than beat and often suggests an act motivated by the wish to reprove someone for insolence or misbehavour: threatening to thrash him within an inch of his life unless he took back the insult. This word is also used to describe a thorough defeat at anything: they thrashed the opposition in the chess tournament.

这些词指的是主要用手或手中握着的某种工具殴打而施加的体罚。Beat 是这些词中最普遍但也最不具体的。它可能最强烈地暗示用拳头捶打；这可能是对手之间一时愤怒的结果：放学后殴打他的流氓。但这个词也可以暗示上级对下级更有意的惩罚：一个精神病母亲无情地殴打她的孩子。在后一种情况下，很可能会使用某种工具：用卷起的报纸打狗。Thrash 更可能局限于第一种情况，表达对手之间自发的愤怒。虽然拳击可能是攻击的主要元素，但这个词暗示了一种以任何方式进行的一般性的敲打。 Thrash 表示比 beat 更彻底或更有条理的行为，通常表示出于谴责某人傲慢或不当行为的动机而采取的行为：威胁说如果他不收回侮辱，就会狠狠地揍他一顿。这个词也用来描述任何事情的彻底失败：他们在象棋比赛中击败了对手。

Spank is very much more specific than either beat or thrash in its application. It refers unambiguously to the corrective or salutary punishment meted out by a parent on a child, with no intent to inflict actual harm. The action specifically involves hitting the child’s buttocks with the open hand, often with the child laid face-down across the parent’s knees. [George Bernard Shaw wondered how parents could wait until their anger had cooled in order to spank their children in cold blood.] The remaining words all relate to punishment meted out by means of some instrument, usually one held in the hand.

打屁股的用法比殴打或鞭打要具体得多。它明确地指的是父母对孩子施加的矫正或有益的惩罚，而无意造成实际伤害。具体来说，这种行为是用手掌击打孩子的臀部，通常是让孩子面朝下趴在父母的膝盖上。[萧伯纳想知道父母怎么能等到怒火平息后才冷血地打孩子屁股。] 其余的词都与通过某种工具（通常是拿在手中的工具）施加的惩罚有关。

The following words specifically stress the inflicting of physical injury to a degree that is not a necessary implication of the words discussed so far. Whip suggests the beating of someone usually by means of a flexible cord or series of cords expressly designed for this use, made of leather, metal or rope and attached to a handle: whipping the horse into a quicker pace; ordering that the mutinous soldiers be put in irons and whipped. The word, less specifically, can refer to any act of beating done by means of any sort of instrument, whether flexible or rigid, whether improvised or designed for the occasion: known to whip prisoners in his charge with a razor strop or a metal ruler; claiming that his interrogators had pistol-whipped him. Scourge is often used metaphorically for any calamity or harsh attack; but most concretely, it refers specifically to beating with a many-tongued or many-thonged whip. In this sense, however, it is less often used except in reference to the Biblical account of Christ being scourged.

以下词语特别强调了造成身体伤害的程度，但这种程度并非上述词语的必然含义。鞭子通常指用一根或一系列专门为此设计的柔软绳索殴打某人，这些绳索由皮革、金属或绳索制成，并系在手柄上：用鞭子抽马，使其加快速度；命令将叛变士兵戴上镣铐鞭打。这个词不太具体，可以指用任何类型的工具进行的任何殴打行为，无论是柔性的还是刚性的，无论是临时的还是专门设计的：以用剃刀皮带或金属尺鞭打他负责的囚犯而闻名；声称审讯者用手枪鞭打他。鞭子通常用来比喻任何灾难或严厉的攻击；但最具体地说，它特指用多条舌头或多条皮带的鞭子殴打。然而，在这个意义上，它很少被使用，除非是指圣经中基督被鞭打的记载。

Flog may specifically suggest whipping, especially with a many-tongued lash, but it can also indicate beating with any sort of instrument, flexible or rigid: suspected informers who were flogged with chains before being killed. A historical context unique to this word is the nautical one in which this sort of set punishment was inflicted upon sailors for certain infractions of orders. The word might also apply in this way to military or penal situations: Convicts were mercilessly flogged in Australia’s early days. Flagellate, most strictly, was a religious or psychosexual context. In either case the sheer infliction of pain is emphasized and is carried out by means of whip, lash or other cord-like instrument, often many-tongued, knotted, barbed or nettled, although this may be applied by oneself or by others, especially (as with flog) across the back. Religious zealots engaged in this activity to punish the flesh for its inherent sinfulness, and sado-masochistic neurotics may engage in flagellation for the sexual stimulation it affords them.

Flog 可能特指鞭打，尤其是用多舌鞭子，但也可以指用任何类型的器械，无论是柔性的还是刚性的，进行殴打：被怀疑是告密者的人在被杀之前会被用锁链鞭打。这个词独有的历史背景是航海背景，在航海背景中，这种固定的惩罚是对违反某些命令的水手施加的。这个词也可能以这种方式适用于军事或刑事情况：在早期的澳大利亚，罪犯会遭到无情的鞭打。Flagellate 最严格地说是一种宗教或性心理背景。在这两种情况下，都强调纯粹的痛苦施加，并通过鞭子、皮鞭或其他绳状器械来进行，这些器械通常有许多舌状的、打结的、有倒钩的或荨麻的，尽管这可以由自己或他人施加，尤其是（与鞭打一样）在背部。宗教狂热分子从事这种活动是为了惩罚肉体固有的罪孽，而施虐受虐狂神经质患者可能会从事鞭笞以获得其带来的性刺激。


4.70 Beautiful
These words refer to pleasing facial appearances. Beautiful indicates a strikingly desirable or attractive face, suggesting symmetry of features or perfection of proportion, although ultimately the word is dependent on the subjective taste of the user. Because of this it is extremely unspecific in reference, although it would most often be used of a woman’s face. Good-looking is equally as weak in specificity, but it can be used appropriately of both men and women: a good-looking couple.

这些词指的是令人赏心悦目的面部外观。Beautiful 表示一张令人心动或迷人的脸，暗示五官对称或比例完美，尽管这个词最终取决于使用者的主观品味。正因为如此，它在指称上非常不具体，尽管它最常用于指女性的脸。Good-looking 的具体性同样很弱，但它可以恰当地用于男性和女性：一对相貌出众的夫妇。

Handsome and pretty are complementary terms in that handsome usually applies to men and pretty even more exclusively to women. Pretty, however, indicates a less elevated or more superficial appeal than beautiful: the rare woman who is truly beautiful as opposed to the many who are merely pretty. In this opposition, pretty might suggest vivacity and sweetness, while beautiful might suggest elegance and nobility. Handsome, used of men, is comparable to beautiful, used of women, suggesting regularity of features and a sturdy manliness. Sometimes handsome may be used of women as well, in which case it does not, strangely enough, suggest an epicene mannishness, but a radiant force of almost animal good health and vividness: insisting that Garbo was not merely beautiful, but breathtakingly handsome. Handsome in this sense would be used only of mature women, never of girls. Pretty would never be used of a man, except pejoratively to suggest effeminacy. Beautiful may rarely be used of a man without negative effect; in this case the face is usually regarded in an artistic light or as redolent of some special attribute: a man with beautiful features; a beautiful and expressive face that spoke both of strength and of suffering.

Handsome 和 pretty 是互补词，handsome 通常适用于男性，而 pretty 则更专指女性。然而，pretty 表示的吸引力比 beautiful 更低级或更肤浅：真正美丽的女性很少，而大多数女性仅仅是漂亮而已。在这种对立中，pretty 可能暗示活泼甜美，而 beautiful 可能暗示优雅高贵。用于男性的 Handsome 相当于用于女性的 beautiful，暗示五官端正和刚强的男子气概。有时 beautiful 也用于女性，但奇怪的是，在这种情况下，它并不暗示女性化的男子气概，而是一种近乎动物般的健康和活力的光芒：坚持认为嘉宝不仅仅是漂亮，而且英俊得令人窒息。这种意义上的 Handsome 只用于成熟女性，从不用于女孩。pretty 绝不会用于男性，除非贬义地暗示女性化。beautiful 很少用于男性而不产生负面影响；在这种情况下，脸部通常被视为具有艺术感或具有某些特殊属性：一个具有美丽特征的男人；一张美丽而富有表现力的脸，既诉说着力量，也诉说着痛苦。

Because comely may now sound outdated, it is sometimes used to suggest earthy or rustic good looks in women: the comely milkmaid in a Constable painting. Once its particular emphasis, however, was on freedom from blemish, as in the Song of Solomon: "I am black, but comely.?Cute is an informal word for prettiness in women that suggests general attractiveness and cheerfulness; thus it conveys something a little less than pretty. Cute may also be used by women to describe men who may not be handsome but who are boyish or sweet-tempered. Gorgeous is sometimes used hyperbolically to refer to someone extremely beautiful or handsome; like many hyperboles its extravagance has tended to strip it of meaning.	
	
因为“comely”现在听起来可能有些过时，所以有时它被用来形容女性朴实或质朴的美貌：康斯特布尔画作中那位漂亮的挤奶女工。然而，它曾经特别强调的是没有瑕疵，就像《所罗门之歌》中说的：“我皮肤黝黑，但长得漂亮。”“cute”是一个非正式的词，用来形容女性的漂亮，暗示着普遍的吸引力和开朗；因此它传达了一点不那么漂亮的意思。女性也可能会用“cute”来形容那些可能不帅但孩子气或性情温和的男性。“gorgeous”有时被夸张地用来指代非常漂亮或英俊的人；像许多夸张一样，它的夸张往往会剥夺它的意义。

4.71 Begin
These words refer to the earliest period in a thing’s existence. Begin, the broadest term of this group, means to take the first step or do the first act or part of something: to begin a course of study leading to a doctorate; to begin to understand one’s past mistakes. In many contexts start is interchangeable with begin: The engine started (or began) smoking. But start places more emphasis on the fact of making a beginning, the mere act of setting out, whereas begin often suggests the start of a process in fulfillment of a purpose. The relationship between start and begin is not unlike that between speed and velocity; the second word in both sets implies direction. [He was beginning to think of himself as an old man; She started (or began) skiing last winter; The train started with a lurch.]

这些词指事物存在的最早时期。begin 是这组词中最宽泛的术语，意为迈出第一步或做某事的第一步或第一部分：开始攻读博士学位的课程；开始认识到自己过去的错误。在很多情况下，start 可以与 begin 互换：发动机启动了（或开始）冒烟。但 start 更强调开始的事实，即出发这一单纯的行为，而 begin 通常暗示为实现某种目的而开始一个过程。start 和 begin 之间的关系类似于速度和速率之间的关系；这两个组中的第二个词都表示方向。[他开始认为自己是个老人了；她去年冬天开始（或开始）滑雪；火车突然开动了。]

Commence is a more formal word for begin. There are practically no contexts in which begin will not serve very well in place of commence, but commence, and sometimes institute, is preferred in some context, especially legal, where begin is felt to be insufficiently formal, too much an everyday word, to dignify the proceedings. Thus legal action is instituted, rarely begun, and judicial sessions commence, seldom begin.Commence is sometimes used vulgarly or humorously in other than solemn contexts: We commenced to drink our beer. Institute in other senses means to begin with a view towards setting up or putting into operation: to institute needed reforms in the ministry. Institute suggests a great deal of enterprise, and frequently foresight as well: to institute new management methods that saved millions of dollars.

Commence 是 begin 的更正式的词。在几乎所有情况下，begin 都不能很好地代替 begin，但在某些情况下，尤其是法律情况下，更倾向于使用 begin，有时也使用 institute，因为 begin 被认为不够正式，太过日常用语，不足以使诉讼程序显得庄重。因此，法律诉讼很少是 initiated，而司法会议很少是 begin。除了庄严的语境外，Commence 有时也被粗俗或幽默地使用：我们开始喝啤酒。Institute 的其他含义是指开始着眼于建立或实施：在部委中制定必要的改革。Institute 暗示着大量的进取心，也常常暗示着远见：制定新的管理方法，节省数百万美元。
	
Initiate is close to institute in pointing to the motivating force or creator that starts something, but does not, like institute, convey theidea of carrying through what one has started to the point of seeing it in operation: to initiate legislation; He initiated the reforms, but the government agency instituted them.

发起与制度（institute）接近，都是指启动某件事的动机或创造者，但并不像制度那样表达将一个人已开始的事情贯彻到看到其运作的意思：发起立法；他发起了改革，但制定这些改革的是政府机构。

Inaugurate means to begin formally or officially. Thus to inaugurate a new policy or legislation suggests some ceremony or traditional observance to commemorate it. [Once a president is inaugurated, he begins his term of office; The ball was inaugurated by the introduction to society of several young debutantes.] The word is also used for begin in historical contexts implying great scope or import: The Industrial Revolution inaugurated a new era.

就职意味着正式开始。因此，就职一项新政策或新立法意味着要举行某种仪式或传统仪式来纪念它。[总统就职后，他的任期就开始了；舞会由几位初入社交界的年轻人介绍而开始。]这个词也用于表示开始的历史语境中，表示范围或意义重大：工业革命开创了一个新时代。

Launch is a related word, but means to begin not so much with ceremony as with fanfare and publicity. [The Treasury is launching a new government loan; The advertising agency will launch a campaign to introduce a new soap.] This sense doubtless derives from the fanfare attached to the launching of large sea-going vessels.

Launch 是一个相关词，但它的意思不是以仪式开始，而是以大张旗鼓和宣传开始。[财政部正在发行一笔新的政府贷款；广告公司将发起一场推广新肥皂的活动。] 这个意思无疑源于大型远洋船只下水时的喧嚣。

4.72 Beginner
These words refer to someone who has not yet acquired the skills and experience that are required to qualify him in a given field. Beginner is the most informal of these words and is the least negative intone, suggesting someone who has already started to acquire the necessary abilities but has not worked long enough to master them; the word may imply a young person, but this is not necessarily so: a ballet class for adult beginners; piano lessons for children and beginners. Apprentice most concretely refers to a young person taken on by a master to be taught the skills of a trade: the apprentice who becomes a qualified tradesman. In broader uses, the word refers to any beginner, often with an emphasis on his low or menial position or lack of polish: a writer whose first book reveals him to be an apprentice rather than a mature artist.

这些词指的是尚未获得某一领域所需技能和经验的人。Beginner 是这些词中最不正式的，也是否定语调最不严重的，指的是已经开始获得必要能力，但是还没有努力足够长的时间来掌握它们的人；这个词可能暗指年轻人，但不一定如此：针对成人初学者的芭蕾舞班；针对儿童和初学者的钢琴课。Apprentice 最具体是指被师傅收下学习一门手艺的年轻人：成为合格工匠的学徒。在更广泛的用法中，这个词指的是任何初学者，通常强调他的地位低下或卑微，或者缺乏磨练：如果一位作家的第一本书表明他还是位学徒，而不是成熟的艺术家。

Both novice and neophyte, but especially the former, may refer to a newly introduced member of a religious order. In broader contexts, both are less factual and more uncomplimentary. Novice in this case may suggest clumsiness due to lack of training or even to an amateurish lack of discipline or application: light meters made so that even the rankest novice can use them; a novice whose canvases show the lowest possible standards and the worst set of influences. Neophyte may be used somewhat less negatively than novice, especially since it implies an eagerness to learn and a humble respect for an seeking out of knowledgeable authority: the neophytes who clustered around the established poet in hopes of catching some pearl of wisdom he seemed always on the verge of dropping.

novice 和 neophyte 都可能指宗教团体中新加入的成员，特别是前者。在更广泛的语境中，两者都不太符合事实，而且更不恭维。在这种情况下，novice 可能暗示由于缺乏训练或甚至由于业余缺乏纪律或应用而导致的笨拙：光度计的制作方式是即使是最差的新手也可以使用；新手的画布显示出最低的标准和最糟糕的影响。Neophyte 的用法可能比 novice 稍微不那么贬义，特别是因为它意味着渴望学习和对寻求知识权威的谦卑尊重：新手们聚集在成名诗人身边，希望抓住他似乎总是即将掉落的智慧珍珠。

Tyro (also tiro) is perhaps the most negative of these words in that it refers to an inexperienced and amateurish approach to a complicated field, suggesting a raw or young recruit who has yet to begin the task of mastering his craft: the tyro who has taken one or two survey courses in literature and proceeds to write critical reviews for his school paper.

Tyro (也作 tiro) 可能是这些词中最负面的，因为它指的是对复杂领域采取的缺乏经验和业余的态度，指尚未开始掌握其技艺的新手或年轻人：新手已经修过一两门文学概论课程，并​​开始为校报撰写评论。

4.73 Beginning
These words are used to refer to things that are in the initial or early stage of existence or to things that are unformed, undeveloped or elementary in character. Beginning, the most general of the five, can mean either first or early. The beginning chapter of a book is its first chapter; the beginning section of the same book would embrace the first chapter but would also include several of the other early chapters. In another sense, beginning describes something that deals with elementary principles, skills or routines: The beginning course in physics will not be offered this term.

这些词用于指处于存在初始或早期阶段的事物，或指未成形、未发展或基本性质的事物。Beginning 是五个词中最常用的，可以表示第一或早期。一本书的开头章节是其第一章；同一本书的开头部分将包括第一章，但也包括其他几个早期章节。从另一个意义上讲，beginning 描述的是涉及基本原理、技能或惯例的事物：本学期将不提供物理学入门课程。

Incipient shares with beginning the meaning of just coming into existence: The incipient stage of a urinary infection is often marked by high fever. Inchoate, like beginning and incipient, can describe a condition or activity that has just recently come into existence or operation. It more often suggests the absence of order, form or coherence: an inchoate plan, badly organized and full of contradictions. One of the general meanings of inchoate, that referring to a lack of completion or perfection, is part of the specialized terminology of the legal profession. An inchoate contract is one that has not been executed by all the parties involved.

Incipient 与 beginning 具有相同的含义，即刚刚开始：尿路感染的早期阶段通常以高烧为特征。Inchoate 与 beginning 和 incipient 一样，可以描述刚刚出现或运行的状态或活动。它更常表示缺乏秩序、形式或连贯性：一个不完整的计划，组织混乱，充满矛盾。inchoate 的一般含义之一是指不完整或不完美，是法律专业术语的一部分。不完整的合同是指尚未由所有相关方执行的合同。

Rudimentary, which means fundamental or elementary, is often used to express a limitation: He had only a rudimentary knowledge of chemistry. It also can characterize something as primitive, undeveloped or imperfectly developed. [Their dwelling place was rudimentary in nature, rather more like a hut than a house; A pair of rudimentary hind legs are part of the skeleton of the boa constrictor.]

Rudimentary 的意思是基础的或初级的，通常用来表达一种局限性：他对化学只有基本的了解。它也可以描述某事物是原始的、未开发的或不完善的。[他们的住所本质上是简陋的，更像小屋而不是房子；一对未开发的后腿是蟒蛇骨骼的一部分。]

Primeval refers to the earliest ages of the world, particularly to that time before the appearance of man on earth: the primeval forests of Europe. It is applied by extension to tings that are very old and have
existed since time immemorial: primeval rocks.

太古是指世界最早的时代，特别是人类出现之前的时代：欧洲的原始森林。它被引申为非常古老且自远古时代就存在的事物：原始岩石。

4.74 Behaviour
These words refer to the characteristic ways that people reveal themselves in their actions. Behaviour is the most general of these; at its most technical, it refers to all activity of people, singly or collectively, that might be studied by psychologists, sociologists or anthropologists: paranoid behaviour; peer-group behaviour in preschool children; mating behaviour in New Guinea. In everyday use, the word more frequently refers to positive or negative social activity: promising to be on my best behaviour; such incredibly rude behaviour. Conduct can also refer to individual or group activity, but in a less technical sense than behaviour; it also may be categorized positively or negatively. It does suggest a narrower range of activity than behaviour, implying the breaking or following of prescribed rules: a bad-conduct discharge from the army; a prison sentence commuted for good conduct. The word is distinct from these other words because it may suggest an ethical or moral basis for measuring behaviour: conduct befitting an honest man.

这些词指的是人们在行为中展现自我的典型方式。行为是这些词中最笼统的；从最专业的角度来说，它指的是人们的所有活动，无论是单独还是集体，可供心理学家、社会学家或人类学家研究：偏执行为；学龄前儿童的同龄群体行为；新几内亚的交配行为。在日常使用中，这个词更多指的是积极或消极的社交活动：承诺表现最好；这种极其粗鲁的行为。行为也可以指个人或群体活动，但不如行为那么专业；它也可以分为积极或消极两类。它所表示的活动范围比行为要窄，意味着违反或遵守规定的规则：因行为不端被军队开除；因行为良好而减刑。这个词与其他词不同，因为它可能表示衡量行为的伦理或道德基础：适合诚实人的行为。

Manners refers not so much to adherence to ethical standards as to the arbitrary forms by which a social group has traditionally acted. Here a positive or negative evaluation may depend on subjective taste as much as anything else: the vulgar manners of the nouveau riche; the easy, natural manners that were second nature to her. The word most often refers to individuals, but can sometimes apply collectively to a whole social group: the affected manners of our debased age.

礼仪不仅仅指遵守道德标准，还指社会群体传统行为的任意形式。在这里，正面或负面的评价可能取决于主观品味，而不是其他任何东西：暴发户的粗俗举止；对她来说轻松自然的举止是第二天性。这个词通常指个人，但有时也可以集体适用于整个社会群体：我们这个堕落时代的矫揉造作的举止。

Deportment is a more formal synonym for conduct, but the set of rules that measure deportment may be arbitrary choices to facilitate a goal or may be superimposed from above, instigated especially to instil a respect for authority. It refers also to manner of bearing, carriage and address as well as to general conduct. A common use is to describe the behaviour of pupils in school: sending home remarks critical of his uncooperative deportment; measures to improve the deportment of her class. Demeanour is distinct from all these words in that it almost exclusively refers to the way a particular person acts at a particular time, and suggests an assessment of the person’s dress, bearing, attitude and expression: a habitually quiet man who had never shown such an agitated demeanour: a supervisor known for her invariably soft-spoken and relaxed demeanour.

举止是品行更正式的同义词，但衡量举止的一套规则可能是为实现目标而任意选择，也可能是上级强加的，特别是为了培养对权威的尊重。它也指举止、姿态和称谓的方式以及一般行为。一种常见的用法是描述学生在校的行为：发送批评其不合作举止的评论回家；采取措施改善班级的举止。举止与所有这些词的不同之处在于，它几乎只指某个人在特定时间的行为方式，并表明对该人的着装、举止、态度和表情的评价：一个习惯性安静的男人从未表现出如此激动的举止：一个以说话轻声细语和举止放松而闻名的主管。

4.75 Beleaguer
These words mean to harass or torment, another person so persistently as to disturb his peace of mind or undermine his self-confidence. Beleaguer, from its literal meaning of surrounding and shutting in an enemy force with one’s own army, carries the implication of a hemming in on all sides by a multitude, so that escape is virtually impossible: a landlord beleaguered by complaining tenants; a man beleaguered by worries; a countryside beleaguered by a plague of locusts.

这些词的意思是不断骚扰或折磨他人，以扰乱其内心的平静或破坏其自信。Beleaguer 的字面意思是用自己的军队包围和关押敌军，它隐含着四面受敌，几乎无法逃脱的意思：地主被抱怨的佃户包围；一个人被忧虑所困扰；乡村被蝗灾所困扰。

Hound strongly suggests the relentless and unflagging pursuit of a hunting dog on the scent: an escaped criminal hounded from city to city by police. By extension, hound also implies repeated urging, especially to the point where the victim can do little except submit: to be hounded by bill collectors; a teacher hounded from his job because of his political views.

Hound 强烈暗示着猎犬对气味的不懈追捕：逃犯被警方从一个城市追到另一个城市。从广义上讲，hound 也暗示着反复的催促，尤其是到了受害者除了屈服别无选择：被收账员追捕；因政治观点而被解雇的老师。

The literal meaning of bait is to set dogs for sport on a chained or penned animal, especially a bear or a bull. Figuratively, bait implies malicious pleasure in tormenting another by teasing and ridicule, especially when retaliation is difficult: baited by the other boys at school for his poor showing in sports; to bait an old man whose ideas are not in agreement with yours. Bait may also mean to tease or twit in a more or less amiable way: He baited his wife for spending so much time talking on the telephone.

bait 的字面意思是用狗来捉弄拴在链子上或关在围栏里的动物，尤其是熊或公牛。bait 的形象意思是通过戏弄和嘲笑来折磨他人，从而获得恶意的快感，尤其是在难以报复的情况下：在学校里，因为运动成绩差而被其他男孩取笑；因为意见与你不一致而被取笑。bait 也可能意味着以或多或少和蔼可亲的方式取笑或嘲弄：他取笑妻子，因为她花了很多时间打电话。

Ride, which is chiefly colloquial, evokes the action of urging a mount on to greater speed by the use of spurs or a whip. Therefore, ride may imply driving or goading someone to reach a goal (not necessarily an undesirable one), but often suggests mischievous or malicious intent. [Parents complain that the fifth-grade teacher rides her brighter pupils too hard; The boys at the office are always riding me because my wife calls me at five o’clock sharp every day to make sure I’m coming straight home.]

Ride 主要用于口语，指用马刺或鞭子催促坐骑加速的行为。因此，ride 可能暗示驱使或怂恿某人达到某个目标（不一定是不良目标），但通常暗示恶作剧或恶意。[家长抱怨五年级老师对聪明的学生太严厉；办公室里的男孩们总是欺负我，因为我妻子每天五点整打电话告诉我是否直接回家。]

Heckle emphasizes the harassing of a speaker in public by means of taunts, questions, and other interruptions in order to confuse or intimidate him or to ferret out the weaknesses in his argument: to heckle a candidate for political office; to heckle the leader of an anti-war demonstration.

诘问强调在公共场合通过嘲讽、提问和其他打断的方式骚扰演讲者，目的是使他感到困惑或恐吓他，或者找出他论点中的弱点：诘问政治职位候选人；诘问反战示威活动的领导者。

Hector strongly suggests bullying and browbeating by scolding or derision: an authoritarian father who hectors his children instead of trying to understand them; a warder who keeps order by hectoring his prisoners.

赫克托尔强烈暗示着通过责骂或嘲笑进行欺凌和威胁：一个专制的父亲，他威吓他的孩子而不是试图去理解他们；一个狱卒，通过威吓囚犯来维持秩序。

4.76 Believable
These words all mean capable of being believed or worthy of being accepted as real, true or trustworthy. Believable is the most general term and describes anything that is possible, probable or acceptable either because it is in accordance with one’s everyday experience and observation or because it is not directly contrary to fact. [He gave us a frightening, but believable, account of his childhood in the slums; The boy’s tale of meeting a pirate on the deserted beach is simply not believable.]

这些词都表示能够被相信或值得被接受为真实、正确或值得信赖。可信是最通用的术语，描述任何可能、大概或可接受的事物，因为它符合人们的日常经验和观察，或者因为它不直接与事实相反。[他给我们讲述了一个令人恐惧但可信的童年贫民窟故事；那个男孩在荒凉的海滩上遇到海盗的故事简直令人难以置信。]

Credible is sometimes used interchangeably with believable: a believable excuse for his lateness; a credible explanation for having failed to finish his work. However, credible goes a step beyond believable in that something that is credible merits belief and is supported by known facts: a credible account of the causes of World War II. Credible is now rarely used of persons except in the expression credible witness ?that is, a witness who is reliable and trustworthy in giving accurate testimony.

可信有时与可信交替使用：他迟到的可信借口；未能完成工作的可信解释。然而，可信比可信更进一步，可信的东西值得相信，并有已知事实的支持：对第二次世界大战原因的可信描述。可信现在很少用于人，除了可信证人这个表达——即可靠和值得信赖的证人，能够提供准确的证词。

Something that is convincing is believable because it overcomes any doubt, uncertainty, or hesitancy in accepting it. A convincing argument compels one’s belief in its soundness because it satisfies the sense of logic or fitness.

令人信服的论据之所以可信，是因为它能克服人们接受它时产生的任何怀疑、不确定性或犹豫。令人信服的论据迫使人们相信它的合理性，因为它满足逻辑或适用性。

The earlier meaning of plausible adhered closely to its etymology, "worthy of applause" ?that is, commendable or capable of winning favourable acceptance by the mind. It now carries a strong implication of deception and speciousness. A plausible statement will very likely be one that appears to be convincing or believable on the surface, but which, upon closer examination, is not so.

plausible 的早期含义与其词源“值得称赞”密切相关，即值得称赞或能够赢得思想的青睐。现在它带有强烈的欺骗和似是而非的含义。plausible 的说法很可能表面上看起来令人信服或可信，但仔细检查后却发现并非如此。

4.77 Belittle
These words refer to criticism designed to diminish the worth of something. Belittle is the most general and informal of these; it may suggest a deliberately fault-finding attitude: belittle every practical suggestion she came up with. It may imply an attitude that simply cannot tolerate excellence or effort in others: belittling those who had continued to work on the project after he had given up. It may also suggest a cumulatively telling process of slight or trivial attempts to undermine another’s position: constantly belittling everything he believed in.
	
这些词指的是旨在贬低某事物价值的批评。贬低是这些词中最普遍和最不正式的；它可能暗示一种故意挑剔的态度：贬低她提出的每一个切实可行的建议。它可能暗示一种根本不能容忍他人优秀或努力的态度：贬低那些在他放弃后继续从事该项目的人。它也可能暗示一种累积的过程，即通过轻微或琐碎的企图来破坏他人的地位：不断贬低他所相信的一切。

Minimize is a more formal substitute for belittle: it refers specifically to the attempt to set a lower value on something than it commonly carries or deserves: minimizing the worth of civil defence measures previously in force. In contrast to belittle, any not of spiteful censoriousness may be absent from this word, which by its formality may emphasize, instead, a judicious or reasoned reassessment: minimizing the effect of Augustine on later medieval thought. The sense of animus, by contrast, is definitely present in detract, even to a greater degree than in belittle. Where belittle, furthermore, may suggest a sniping at trivial failings, detract suggests an attempt at a more drastic lowering of esteem: a fiercely argued view that sought to detract from the usefulness of the earlier study.

Minimize 是 belittle 的更正式替代词：它特指试图将某事物的价值设定得比其通常具有或应得的价值更低：将先前实施的民防措施的价值降至最低。与 belittle 相反，这个词可能没有任何恶意的批评，而是通过其正式性来强调明智或理性的重新评估：将奥古斯丁对后期中世纪思想的影响降至最低。相比之下，detract 中肯定存在敌意，甚至比 belittle 中更甚。此外，belittle 可能暗示对琐碎缺点的嘲讽，而 detract 则暗示试图更彻底地降低尊重：一种激烈争论的观点，试图贬低早期研究的实用性。

Disparage and deprecate contrast with the foregoing words by suggesting a general effort to make something seem without worth or value. Disparage suggests the animus of detract, but may imply a seizing caustically disparaging each new production as further proof of the playwright’s worthlessness, while deprecate may sometimes suggest only an attempt to devalue rather than to reject something utterly, its effect is strengthened by the amused, scornful, or sarcastic consideration it implies: deprecating the notion of a take-over with a weary laugh. Depreciate is mainly used intransitively, meaning to fall in value, but some purists assert that depreciate and not deprecate should be used in the sense of lowering or underestimating the worth of: the tendency of people who are not talented to depreciate those who are. Many excellent writers, however, use deprecate in this sense, and it can only be considered a well-established usage today.

Disparage 和 deprecate 与前面的词语形成对比，都暗示着一种普遍的努力，使某事物看起来毫无价值。Disparage 暗示着贬低的敌意，但可能意味着对每部新作品进行尖刻的贬低，以进一步证明剧作家的无用；而 deprecate 有时可能只暗示试图贬低某事物，而不是完全拒绝某事物，它的效果因其暗示的有趣、轻蔑或讽刺的考虑而得到加强：用疲倦的笑声贬低接管的概念。Depreciate 主要用于不及物动词，意思是贬低价值，但一些纯粹主义者认为 depreciate 而不是 deprecate 应该用来表示降低或低估价值：没有天​​赋的人倾向于贬低有天赋的人。然而，许多优秀的作家都以这种意义使用 deprecate，而且它只能被认为是当今一种成熟的用法。

Discredit is the most severe of these words, exclusively suggesting criticism deigned to demolish a position or accomplishment utterly, often by unfair means: attempting to discredit his opponent by glancing and suggestive references to his personal life.

诋毁是这些词语中最严重的一个，专指旨在彻底摧毁某个立场或成就的批评，通常采用不公平的手段：试图通过瞥一眼或暗示性地提及对手的个人生活来诋毁对手。

4.78 Bend
These verbs are applied to bodily movements and denote a change from a straight, natural, or fixed position. Bend implies a folding movement of the head or body or an angular movement at a joint: to bend from the waist; to bend the elbow. Lean refers to a sloping movement away from an erect position. It implies a slant in a certain direction or a propping against a support. The leaning body or part, itself, is straight or only slightly curved, though at an angle. [Lean back and relax; Lean your head on my shoulder; He leaned against the wall.] When bend and lean are close in meaning, bend suggests a more marked downward movement and implies greater effort, force or concentration. [The clerk leaned over the counter; the student bent over his books.]	

这些动词用于身体动作，表示从平直、自然或固定姿势改变。弯曲意味着头部或身体的弯曲运动，或关节的成角度运动：从腰部弯曲；弯曲肘部。倾斜是指从直立姿势倾斜的动作。它意味着向某个方向倾斜或靠在支撑物上。倾斜的身体或部分本身是直的，或者只是稍微弯曲，尽管有角度。[向后靠，放松；把头靠在我肩上；他靠在墙上。]当弯曲和倾斜的意思相近时，弯曲暗示更明显的向下运动，意味着更大的努力、力量或注意力。[店员靠在柜台上；学生弯腰看书。]

To bow is to bend the head or upper body forwards and down: to bend over backwards; to lean sideways; to bow before the king. Bowing is a formal action, done for a symbolic rather than a practical purpose.] Bend down and pick it up; Bow down and worship.] One may bow to show reverence, respect, humility or submission: to bow before an altar; to bow the head and bend the knee in prayer. Or one may bow as a matter of custom, formal courtesy or protocol: to bow to one’s audience after performing; a bowing headwaiter; bowing diplomats. In bending over, leaning down or bowing from the waist, one lowers the body by bending the back.

鞠躬是将头或上身向前向下弯曲：向后弯腰；向侧面倾斜；在国王面前鞠躬。鞠躬是一种正式动作，具有象征意义而非实际目的。] 弯腰捡起；鞠躬崇拜。] 鞠躬可以表示敬畏、尊重、谦卑或顺从：在祭坛前鞠躬；祈祷时低头屈膝。或者，鞠躬可以作为一种习俗、正式礼节或礼节：表演后向观众鞠躬；鞠躬的领班；向外交官鞠躬。在弯腰、俯身或鞠躬时，人们通过弯曲背部来放低身体。

To stoop is to lower the body by bending the knees: He stooped down to talk to the child on the child’s own level. Posture experts prefer stooping to bending because, in stooping, the head and torso remain upright and no strain is put on the back. In another sense, however, stoop indicates poor posture, describing a habitual forward inclination of the head and shoulders: stooped shoulders.

弯腰是通过弯曲膝盖来降低身体：他弯下腰，与孩子在同一水平上交谈。姿势专家更喜欢弯腰而不是弯腰，因为弯腰时，头部和躯干保持直立，背部不会承受任何压力。然而，从另一个意义上讲，弯腰表示姿势不正确，描述的是头部和肩膀习惯性地向前倾斜：弯腰。

Turn means to move or swing part way round. It implies rotation of the head or body and refers to a change in direction. [Turn to the left; He turned his head to look behind him; She turned to face me; Turn over; Turn round; They turned the patient on his side.] In a special sense, turn may describe a sudden inward collapse or outward wrenching of the ankle that results in a strain or sprain: She stumbled at the kerb and turned her ankle. Twist indicates a strained, contorted, or violent turning of part of the body. It suggests the muscular tension set up when one part of the body changes position while the rest remains in place. [She twisted round in her seat, craning backwards; He twisted my arm.] Twisting may also involve a sinuous bending or winding: to twist one’s legs round a chair. Or it may suggest a constant, restless turning or squirming: He twisted and turned all night.

Turn 的意思是移动或摆动身体的一部分。它意味着头部或身体的旋转，指方向的改变。[转向左边；他转过头看后方；她转过身来面对我；翻身；转过身；他们把病人翻到一边。] 在特殊意义上，turn 可以描述脚踝突然向内塌陷或向外扭动，导致拉伤或扭伤：她在路边绊倒，扭伤了脚踝。Twist 表示身体某部分拉伤、扭曲或剧烈转动。它表明当身体某一部分改变位置而其他部分保持原位时产生的肌肉紧张。[她在座位上扭动身体，向后伸长脖子；他扭动我的胳膊。] Twisting 也可能涉及蜿蜒的弯曲或缠绕：把腿扭在椅子上。或者它可能暗示持续、不安的转动或蠕动：他整晚都在扭动。

All these words may be used in figurative senses. Bend stresses force or flexibility, the power to subdue or the facility to yield, adapt or change: stern and unbending. [The bent to his wishes; He bent (or bowed) them to his will. Bow may imply a submissive yielding suggestive of a broken or servile spirit: bowed down by heavy sorrows; bloody but unbowed; to bow and scrape. Stoop emphasizes the idea of lowering oneself by doing something that one deems degrading: I would not stoop to such methods. Lean stresses the idea of inclination, a sympathy of views that draws one in a certain direction: a moderate who leans toward conservatism. Turn calls to mind a whirling rotation. It may be used of something that makes a person giddy or that causes him to lose his sense of proportion: Compliments turned her head. Twist implies a violent turning out of the natural course and may connote distortion or deformity: to twist someone’s words; a twisted mind.

所有这些词都可以用来做比喻。Bend 强调力量或灵活性、征服的力量或屈服、适应或改变的能力：严厉而不屈从。[屈服于他的意愿；他使它们屈服于他的意志。Bow 可能暗示顺从的屈服，暗示着破碎或奴性的精神：被沉重的悲伤压倒；满身血迹但不屈服；鞠躬和刮擦。Stoop 强调通过做一些自己认为有辱人格的事情来降低自己：我不会屈尊使用这种方法。Lean 强调倾向的概念，对观点的同情将人引向某个方向：倾向于保守主义的温和派。Turn 让人想起旋转。它可能用于使人头晕或使人失去分寸感的事物：赞美使她转过头来。 Twist 暗示着自然进程的剧烈转变，可能暗指扭曲或畸形：扭曲某人的话；扭曲的心智。

4.79 Beneficial
These words describe conditions that are positive in their effect on health or financial well-being. Beneficial is general and relatively formal. While it can refer to financial well-being, it more naturally applies to things conductive to mental or physical health: government programmes beneficial to the poor; a sunny day’s beneficial influence on my darkest moods; milk and vegetables beneficial to a growing child. In one sense, it suggests something that is an added help, but is not strictly necessary: a friendship beneficial to both of them. Good is, of course, the most general word here and the least formal; it has a multitude of uses in pointing to what promotes financial or physical strength: a good climate; good circulation; a good business proposal; a good stock. Its very generality invites the substitution of a more precise synonym.

这些词描述的是对健康或财务状况有积极影响的条件。有益是笼统且相对正式的。虽然它可以指财务状况，但更自然地适用于有益于精神或身体健康的事物：有利于穷人的政府计划；阳光明媚的日子对我最阴郁的情绪的有益影响；牛奶和蔬菜有益于成长中的孩子。从某种意义上说，它暗示某种额外的帮助，但并非绝对必要：对他们俩都有利的友谊。当然，好是这里最笼统、最不正式的词；它有多种用途，可以指促进财务或身体健康的因素：良好的气候；良好的流通；好的商业计划；好的股票。它的笼统性要求我们用更精确的同义词来代替。

Advantageous and profitable are words which carry overtones of financial well-being. Advantageous can, of course, refer to anything chosen for its desirability or to improve one’s situation: a more advantageous view of the sunset; resorts advantageous to the husband-hunting secretary. More often, an actual monetary gain is present or implied: an advantageous position in his firm. Profitable is even clearer on this score: a profitable business in a profitable location; Good looks are a more profitable commodity in Hollywood than talent and hard work. In Victorian times, profitable was often used for something beneficial to the development of character: a profitable book to read for spiritual guidance. This use is less frequent today.

Advantageous 和 profits 这两个词都带有经济富裕的含义。Advantageous 当然可以指任何因其可取性或改善个人处境而选择的事物：更有利的日落景色；对找丈夫的秘书有利的度假胜地。更常见的是，实际的金钱收益是存在或暗示的：在公司中处于有利地位。Profitable 在这一点上更加明确：在有利可图的地点做有利可图的生意；在好莱坞，美貌比才华和勤奋更有利可图。在维多利亚时代，profitable 经常用于指有益于性格发展的事物：一本有益的精神指导读物。这种用法在今天不太常见。

The rest of these words relate more specifically to the promoting of health. Healthful is now fairly restricted in its use. When it is employed it refers to what will give good health or what is conducive to it: the healthful properties of certain foods. On most occasions the term healthy is used, and one has to determine from context whether it means the state of possessing health (see under HEALTHY) or what will give health. Thus the ailing person is concerned with healthy climates and healthy foods, while both he and the healthy person appreciate healthy exercise and healthy activities. Wholesome suggests less the promoting of well-being than the inherently good or healthy situation in and for itself. It also carries a tone of moral uplift and is as often used of mental as of physical health: a wholesome film for the whole family; wholesome food; wholesome good looks. Its overtones become clear when on considers that some healthy activities might decidedly not be considered wholesome in many situations.

其余词语更具体与促进健康有关。Healthful 的使用现在受到严格限制。使用时，它指的是什么会给人带来健康或什么有助于健康：某些食物的健康特性。大多数情况下都会使用 healthy 一词，人们必须根据上下文确定它是指拥有健康的状态（参见 HEALTHY）还是什么会给人带来健康。因此，生病的人关心健康的气候和健康的食物，而他和健康的人都欣赏健康的锻炼和健康的活动。Wholesome 更多地是指内在良好或健康的状况，而不是促进幸福。它还带有道德提升的色彩，经常用于精神和身体健康：适合全家人观看的健康电影；健康的食物；健康的外表。当人们考虑到某些健康活动在许多情况下可能绝对不被认为是健康的时，它的内涵就变得清晰了。

Salutary suggests the correcting of a physical or mental lack: a salutary diet for anemia; sea breezes salutary to insomniacs; an editorial salutary in its fierce honesty and forthright proposals. Salubrious is comparable to but more intense than salutary, suggesting a positive physical or mental enrichment, without suggesting any previous impoverishment. It also describes any invigorating or stimulating experience: the salubrious mineral waters of the spa; the salubrious effects of a long ocean voyage; a salubrious shock to the complacent middle-classes.

Salutary 暗示着纠正身体或精神上的缺陷：有益的饮食可以治疗贫血；海风对失眠症患者有益；社论的诚实和直率建议非常有益。Salubrious 与 salutary 类似，但比 salutary 更强烈，暗示着积极的身体或精神充实，而不暗示任何先前的贫乏。它还描述了任何令人精神振奋或振奋的体验：温泉中有益健康的矿泉水；长途航海的有益效果；对自满的中产阶级的有益冲击。

4.80 Benefit
These words refer to some desirable good that can be given, acquired or earned. Benefit is the most general of these, referring to any kind of good, however, acquired, material or otherwise: lessons designed to be of benefit to growing minds; the benefits accorded to one of his lofty position. Advantage is narrower in scope than benefit, since it can suggest more strictly either material benefits or things won in competition against an opponent: all the advantages of suburban living; a naturally fortified hill that would give them the advantage over the enemy. The word, or course, can function more abstractly and without any implication of depriving someone else of the same benefit: all equally free to take advantages of our tradition of free speech and respect for dissent. Favour may suggest being given the advantage in a competition: ruling in favour of the plaintiff; unequal odds that made the battle sure to come out in the aggressor’s favour. The word, however, most often refers to benefits that result from securing the approval of others: a new product seeking public favour; audiences that looked with favour on his plays. The word can also be used to indicate narrow self-interest: acting only in his own favour.

这些词指的是可以给予、获得或挣得的某种可取之物。利益是其中最普遍的，指的是任何种类的利益，无论是物质的还是其他的：旨在有益于成长的心灵的课程；赋予某人崇高地位的利益。优势的范围比利益要窄，因为它可以更严格地表示物质利益或在与对手的竞争中赢得的东西：郊区生活的所有优势；一座天然防御的山丘，可以让他们比敌人占上风。当然，这个词可以更抽象地发挥作用，而不意味着剥夺别人的同样利益：所有人都可以平等地利用我们言论自由和尊重异议的传统。青睐可能意味着在竞争中被赋予优势：有利于原告的裁决；不平等的机会使得战斗肯定会以侵略者的优势结束。然而，这个词最常指获得他人认可所带来的好处：寻求公众青睐的新产品；对他的戏剧青睐有加的观众。这个词也可以用来表示狭隘的自身利益：只为自己谋利。

Like benefit, gain can suggest an intangible good given or acquired at no one’s expense: a law that resulted in a clear gain for civil liberties; a gain in technical competence over his last word. More commonly, however, the word suggests material acquisition: capital gains; greedy for gain. Profit is even more restricted to material or monetary acquisition: realizing a ten-per-cent profit on each sale; speculators eager for a quick profit. Sometimes, however, the word can refer to gains outside the context of money-making: a book anyone can read with profit.

与收益一样，增益可以表示不以任何人的代价而给予或获得的无形利益：一项明显有利于公民自由的法律；技术能力的提高。然而，更常见的是，这个词表示物质上的获得：资本收益；贪得无厌。利润甚至更局限于物质或货币上的获得：每次销售实现 10% 的利润；投机者渴望快速获利。然而，有时，这个词可以指赚钱之外的收益：一本任何人都可以读并受益的书。

4.81 Benevolence
These words refer to a well-wishing friendliness or concern for the needs and desires of other people. Benevolence has the widest range of any of these words, suggesting an expansive and good-humoured tolerance and sympathy for others: brimming over with a feeling of sunny benevolence towards everyone he encountered. Sometimes the word implies the sympathy of a superior towards a subordinate, an implication strengthened by the word’s formality: working conditions sought as a right, not as a benevolence of their employer. Generosity is more informal and focuses exclusively on the aspect of giving, referring to an unstintingly helpful act or habit: the generosity with which he shared his toys with other children. In contrast to benevolence, which may remain an unacted-upon feeling, generosity is measured by actual behaviour: a plantation owner who looked on his native workers with benevolence but could hardly be accused of treating them with generosity.

这些词指的是一种善意的友好或对他人需求和愿望的关心。仁慈是这些词中含义最广的，它表明对他人的一种宽容和善意的宽容和同情：对他遇到的每个人都充满阳光般的仁慈之情。有时，这个词暗示上级对下级的同情，这个词的正式性强化了这种暗示：工作条件是一种权利，而不是雇主的仁慈。慷慨则更为不正式，只侧重于给予的方面，指的是一种无私的帮助行为或习惯：他慷慨地与其他孩子分享玩具。与仁慈（可能是一种未付诸行动的感情）相反，慷慨是通过实际行为来衡量的：一个种植园主仁慈地看待他的本地工人，但很难被指责为对他们慷慨大方。

At a level of greater in formality, good will and kindness are related somewhat like the previous pair, with good will referring primarily to feeling and kindness to action. Good will may refer to an open, charitable attitude, without reservation or bitterness: Christmas carollers full of merriment and good will. The word may also refer to a willingness to be fair-minded or impartial: both sides bargaining in good will. Kindness may suggest thoughtful or courteous consideration for the feelings of others: neighbour who were always the soul of kindness. Often, however, the word specifically points to the help one person gives to someone less fortunate, less well, or less able than himself: a nurse who treated the sick and wounded with almost reverent kindness. This word, consequently, can sometimes have a patronizing flavour, like benevolence: insisting that he wanted only her good will, not her kindness.

在更正式的层面上，善意和仁慈的关系与前一对有些相似，善意主要指感觉，仁慈则指行动。善意可能指一种开放、仁慈的态度，毫无保留或苦涩：圣诞颂歌充满欢乐和善意。这个词也可能指愿意公平或公正：双方善意地讨价还价。仁慈可能暗示对他人的感受深思熟虑或礼貌的考虑：邻居总是善良的灵魂。然而，这个词通常特别指一个人给予比自己不幸、不如自己好或能力差的人的帮助：一个护士以近乎虔诚的仁慈对待病人和伤员。因此，这个词有时会有一种居高临下的感觉，就像仁慈一样：坚持说他只想要她的善意，而不是她的仁慈。

Unselfishness and altruism both point to a generosity that is based on a lack of self-concern. Where generosity may emphasize the quantity given, possibly for ostentatious reasons, unselfishness stresses the effacing personal sacrifice required ?even if a lesser amount is given: It was the tax deduction involve, rather than unselfishness, that prompted his generosity to the charity appeal. While unselfishness is most often used to indicate a personal trait, the more formal altruism is usually reserved to indicate a moral or ethical principle. The word refers to the setting aside of all special or personal interests in determining which course of action will most benefit the group welfare. This makes the word a more specific and exact synonym for one possibility in good will: Australian Volunteers Abroad, searching for a way to put their youthful altruism into practice.

无私和利他主义都指一种基于缺乏自我关怀的慷慨。慷慨可能强调捐赠的数量，可能是出于炫耀的原因，而无私则强调需要做出谦逊的个人牺牲——即使捐赠的金额较少：正是涉及的税收减免，而不是无私，促使他慷慨地向慈善机构捐款。虽然无私最常用于表示个人品质，但更正式的利他主义通常用于表示道德或伦理原则。这个词指的是在确定哪种行动最有利于集体福利时，将所有特殊或个人利益放在一边。这使得这个词成为一种善意可能性的更具体和准确的同义词：澳大利亚志愿者在国外，正在寻找一种将他们年轻的利他主义付诸实践的方法。

8.82 Bequest
A bequest is something given or left to a person or an institution by the will of a benefactor. A legacy is something given or passed on by an ancestor, a predecessor or an earlier era, and may be contained in a will or transmitted informally or automatically: to receive a legacy of a million dollars from the estate of a deceased aunt; to be heir to a legacy of good will through his father’s reputation. [The United Nations was left a legacy of unsolved problems by the League of Nations.]

遗赠是恩人根据意愿赠予或留给个人或机构的东西。遗产是祖先、前任或更早时代赠予或传给别人的东西，可能包含在遗嘱中，也可能非正式或自动传递：从已故姑母的遗产中得到一百万美元的遗产；通过父亲的名誉继承善意的遗产。[联合国被国际联盟遗留下来一堆未解决的问题。]

An endowment is something settled or bestowed on a person or institution, and is not necessarily a posthumous gift. A philanthropist may, during his lifetime, establish an endowment for scholarships at a university or may bestow upon a deserving student an endowment for paying the costs of his education.

捐赠是设立或赠予个人或机构的物品，不一定是死后赠予的。慈善家在生前可以设立大学奖学金捐赠基金，也可以向优秀学生捐赠以支付其教育费用。

4.83 Between
Between, as here considered, means flanked by two objects, one on either side. [The Tasman Sea lies between Australia and New Zealand; between the devil and the deep blue sea.]

此处所指的“介于”是指两个物体的两侧，一个在另一侧。[塔斯曼海位于澳大利亚和新西兰之间；介于魔鬼和深蓝色的大海之间。]

When between and among are used by extension to indicate a sharing, between is normally used when two objects are involved and among when more than two are involved: an inheritance divided between two heirs and shared among three heirs. Occasionally between is used to express such a relationship involving more than two objects, particularly if the relation involves each object individually or if it involves relationships between pairs of objects within the larger group: A political dispute involving six nations may be settled by an agreement between them.

当 between 和 among 被引申用来表示共享时，between 通常用于涉及两个对象，among 用于涉及两个以上对象：遗产由两个继承人分割，由三个继承人共享。有时，between 也用于表达涉及两个以上对象的关系，特别是当关系涉及每个对象时，或者涉及较大群体中对象对之间的关​​系时：涉及六个国家的政治争端可以通过它们之间的协议来解决。

In precise use, amid means surrounded by either separate objects or an undifferentiated mass or quantity. [A church stands amid skyscrapers; A reaper works amid the grain; A man may keep calm amid confusion.]

准确来说，amid 的意思是被单独的物体或无差别的质量或数量所包围。[教堂矗立在摩天大楼之间；收割者在谷物中劳作；一个人可以在混乱中保持冷静。]

Among, as here considered, means surrounded by or included in a group of separate but similar objects. [Augustus Caesar was called princeps ?chief among equals; A diary was among the effects left by a deceased.] The motion of joint action also requires among: They decided among themselves.

在这里，among 的意思是被一组独立但相似的物体包围或包含在其中。[奥古斯都·凯撒被称为“元首”——平等者中的首领；日记是死者留下的遗物之一。] 联合行动也需要 among：他们自己决定。

Amidst and more particularly amongst are growing in popularity as variants of amid and among, although they were once reserved for contexts where greater dispersion and mixing were involved. Betwixt as a variant of between is generally avoided as archaic or poetic.

Amidst 和 among 这两个词作为 amid 和 among 的变体越来越流行，尽管它们曾经只用于涉及较大分散和混合的语境。Betwixt 作为 between 的变体，一般被避免使用，因为它太过古雅或诗意。


4.84 Biased
These words refer to a lack of fairness in judging or reporting because of the favouritism given to one way of viewing a subject. Biased suggests that someone judging or reporting a controversy is already disposed for or against one of the contending sides: He insisted that the jury was already biased by improper remarks made by the prosecution; an education that gave him a biased view of cultures different from his own; a biased account referring to the local councillors as self-seekers. Prejudiced in this context suggests a mind already disposed specifically against one view of something at issue; it also pertains more to judging something than to reporting it: The fairness of the trial was prejudiced by undue publicity; people who become prejudiced, however subtly, by the constant stereotyping of minority groups. Subjective refers to an inability to put personal interests aside in order to view a situation without preconceptions; it is a relative word in that the most conscientious attempt at objectivity cannot wholly overcome one’s innately subjective perspective: a subjective account of the war, overstressing the importance of those things the author happened to see first hand.

这些词指的是由于偏袒某一观点而导致判断或报道不公正。偏见表明某人在判断或报道争议时已经倾向于支持或反对争论的一方：他坚持认为陪审团已经因公诉方的不当言论而产生偏见；他所受的教育使他对不同于自己文化的文化产生了偏见；带有偏见的报道将当地议员称为利己主义者。在这种情况下，偏见表明思想上已经倾向于反对对某一问题的一种观点；它也更多地适用于判断而非报道：审判的公正性因不当宣传而受到损害；人们因对少数群体的不断刻板印象而产生偏见，无论这种偏见是多么微妙。主观指无法将个人利益放在一边，不带先入之见地看待情况；它是一个相对的词，因为即使最认真地尝试客观性也无法完全克服一个人天生的主观观点：对战争的主观描述，过分强调作者亲眼所见事物的重要性。

Slanted and one-sided pertain mostly to reports rather than to judgements. Slanted suggests the deliberate suppression of some fact and expansion of others either to flatter the biased minds of readers or to convince them that the biased attitudes of the writer or publisher are correct: a news story that was slanted to make the incumbent candidate appear certain of re-election. One-sided suggests a far more extreme position than slanted in that only facts supporting a particular attitude are presented: a one-sided history of the conflict that made it appear to be a struggle between angels and monsters.

偏颇和片面性主要指报道而非判断。偏颇意味着故意隐瞒某些事实而夸大其他事实，以迎​​合读者的偏见或让他们相信作者或出版商的偏见是正确的：新闻报道偏颇，使现任候选人看起来肯定会连任。片面性意味着比偏颇更为极端的立场，因为报道中只呈现了支持特定态度的事实：冲突的片面性历史让这场冲突看起来像是天使与怪物之间的斗争。

Partial and partisan suggest different degrees of alignment with a cause. Partial may suggest either an unconscious or conscious favouring of a particular stand: countries that claimed to be neutral but were actually partial to the West; frankly admitting that he was partial to the union’s set of arguments. Partisan suggests wholehearted and unashamed commitment to and advocacy of a cause: to give equal time to partisan statements on the value of the proposed legislation. A partisan view of a matter is not necessarily unfair, provided the person is an advocate of that view and is not set up to judge between that view and another. One may even be partisan without being one-sided, if one is attentive to and considerate of other viewpoints.

偏袒和党派性表明对某一事业的认同程度不同。偏袒可能意味着对某一立场有意识或无意识的偏袒：声称中立但实际上偏袒西方的国家；坦率地承认他偏袒联盟的一系列论点。党派性表明全心全意、毫无顾忌地致力于和倡导某一事业：对拟议立法的价值给予党派性声明同等的时间。对某件事的党派观点并不一定不公平，只要该人是该观点的拥护者，并且不打算在这种观点和另一种观点之间做出判断。如果一个人关注并考虑其他观点，那么他甚至可以是党派性的，而不会偏袒任何一方。

4.85 Bigotry
These words refer to an unfair, irrational or unexamined attitude towards issues or people based on blanket preconceptions. Bigotry now refers almost exclusively to an intense dislike or even violent hatred for a particular group, race or religion. The comparable use of prejudice would indicate a similar but far less intense predisposition against such a group. Bigotry almost surely would be evidenced in unashamed public utterance or behaviour, whereas prejudice might remain largely unexpressed – or even unknown to the person so afflicted: easier to cope with the outright bigotry of racialist groups than with the unexpressed prejudice of much of respectable society. Prejudice, also, can apply to any preconception: an abhorrence for the maltreatment of animals that would make him unable to hear the case without prejudice.

这些词指的是基于一概而论的偏见而对问题或人采取的一种不公平、不合理或未经审查的态度。偏执现在几乎专门指对某个群体、种族或宗教的强烈厌恶甚至暴力仇恨。偏见的类似用法则表示对这样一个群体有类似但远没有那么强烈的偏见。偏执几乎肯定会表现在毫无羞耻的公开言论或行为中，而偏见可能在很大程度上仍未表达出来 – 或者甚至不为人所知：应对种族主义团体的彻头彻尾的偏执比应对许多体面社会人士未表达出来的偏见更容易。偏见也可以适用于任何先入之见：对虐待动物的憎恶会让他无法不带偏见地听取案件。

Intolerance is used in its general sense of not being able to tolerate – or put up with – some idea or group of people at variance with one’s own thinking: we unfairly regard with intolerance the long hair, strange dress and weird music of our teenager. But it is also used in a similar sense to bigotry and prejudice in racial or religious matters, even if not so strong in its impact. Bias is unique among these words, since it can point to a predisposition either for or against something: He admitted that he had a sentimental bias for anything pertaining to Ireland; a strong bias in slum areas against policemen. Where prejudice can indicate a fixed, inflexible attitude, bias might suggest only a tendency to take a given view. Yet even such a mild predisposition could be disastrous where strict impartiality is required, as in a judge or juror: The lawyer argued that the judge’s bias had affected the conduct of the case.

不宽容的一般含义是指不能容忍或忍受与自己想法不一致的某些想法或群体：我们不公平地以不宽容的态度看待我们十几岁孩子的长发、奇怪的衣服和奇怪的音乐。但它也与种族或宗教问题上的偏执和偏见有类似的意义，即使其影响没有那么强烈。偏见在这些词中是独一无二的，因为它可以指支持或反对某事的倾向：他承认他对任何与爱尔兰有关的事情都有感情上的偏见；贫民窟对警察有强烈的偏见。偏见可以表示一种固定的、不灵活的态度，而偏见可能只表示一种倾向于采取某一观点的倾向。然而，即使是这种轻微的倾向，在需要严格公正的情况下，比如法官或陪审员，也可能是灾难性的：律师辩称法官的偏见影响了案件的审理。

Narrow-mindedness points to a rigidity of preconceived attitudes, but specifically sees them as stemming from inexperience or a lack of exposure to a broader scale of values: the typical narrow-mindedness of people who stay in one rut without ever getting out of it to see how other people live. The word often suggests habitual insularity, backwardness, provinciality and lack of sophistication, but might be evidenced by an uneventful passivity or withdrawal rather than the hostile taking of stands suggested by the first pair: She was prevented from going to theatres or dances by the narrow-mindedness of her parents. But the word can apply to any dogmatic rigidity of view: Permissive parents are often guilty of as much narrow-mindedness as those who are belaboured for their authoritarian views on child-rearing. The word frequently points specifically to a prudish or puritan attitude towards sex or pleasure: He accused her of narrow-mindedness for refusing to have dinner with him in his flat. Obviously, the word is extremely relative and can be used by someone to refer to any behaviour, however, tolerant, that he may not find sufficiently acquiescent.

狭隘是指先入为主的态度僵化，但具体来说，这种态度源于缺乏经验或缺乏接触更广泛的价值观：典型的狭隘思想，指的是那些固步自封、从不跳出来看看别人生活的人。这个词通常表示习惯性的孤僻、落后、狭隘和缺乏成熟，但可能表现为平淡无奇的被动或退缩，而不是第一对句子所暗示的敌对立场：由于父母的狭隘思想，她被阻止去剧院或舞会。但这个词可以适用于任何教条的僵化观点：放纵的父母往往和那些因在育儿方面的专制观点而受到严厉批评的父母一样狭隘。这个词经常具体指对性或快乐的拘谨或清教徒态度：他指责她思想狭隘，因为她拒绝和他一起在他的公寓里吃晚饭。显然，这个词是极其相对的，一个人可以用它来指代任何行为，无论这种行为有多么宽容，但一个人可能认为这种行为还不够默许。

4.86 Bisexual
These words refer to the uniting of both sexes in one individual, either in a biological or psychological sense. Bisexual is the most general of these, having the widest range of possible meaning. In a biological sense, it can refer to any living organism in which both male and female organs are present. For many forms of life, this is normal: bisexual flowers; bisexual angleworms. Thus, as a generic term, the word can group together all normally double-sexed plants and animals. In its reference to people, however, the word would never refer to those rare individuals who are abnormally born with both male and female organs. On the contrary, it refers to those people who, physiologically normal, are psychologically responsive to both sexes: that transitional phase when adolescents are bisexual in their sympathies and loyalties. Many psychologists view every individual as being normally bisexual in make-up, although only those men and women who have both homosexual and heterosexual relations can be called actively bisexual. The word is not likely to be used to describe someone whose appearance combines both male and female characteristics.

这些词语是指两种性别在一个人身上的结合，无论是在生物学意义上还是在心理学意义上。双性恋是这些词语中最普遍的，具有最广泛的含义。从生物学意义上讲，它可以指任何同时存在雄性和雌性器官的生物体。对于许多生命形式来说，这是正常的：双性花；双性蚯蚓。因此，作为一个通用术语，这个词可以将所有正常的双性植物和动物归为一类。然而，在指人时，这个词绝不会指那些生来就同时具有雄性和雌性器官的罕见个体。相反，它指的是那些生理正常、心理上对两种性别都有反应的人：青少年在同情和忠诚方面具有双性恋的过渡阶段。许多心理学家认为每个人的体质都是正常的双性恋，尽管只有那些既有同性恋又有异性恋关系的男性和女性才能被称为积极的双性恋。这个词不太可能用来描述外表兼具男性和女性特征的人。

Hermaphroditic and androgynous are more clear-cut in their reference to biological description. Hermaphroditic refers most specifically as a zoological term to animals in which the organs of both sexes appear normally in each individual, whereas androgynous applies as a botanical term to such double-sexed plants: viewing the volvox either as a colony of cells or as a hermaphroditic organism; effecting the hybridizing of corn by the sexual polarization of a normally androgynous species. Among such sexually polarized species as man, of course, a hermaphroditic individual may rarely occur as a biological abnormality, but the word would be strictly reserved for those cases in which both male and female sexualorgans are anatomically present. Sometimes hermaphroditic is used less technically to refer to general appearance that partakes of both sexes. In this case, the word carries a tone of hyperbolic disapproval or amusement: The hair styles of young people grow more and more hermaphroditic. Androgynous has a more formal ring even in its strict biological use, and can sound abstruse or curious when it applies more generally; here, it is not so likely to be confused with reference to biological structure: cultures in which sexual role-playing is relatively androgynous outside such biological functions as child-bearing.

雌雄同体和雌雄同体在生物学描述中更为明确，雌雄同体是一个动物学术语，指的是每个个体中两性器官都正常出现的动物，而雌雄同体则作为植物学术语适用于这种双性动物。植物：将 volox 视为细胞群或雌雄同体生物；通过正常雌雄同体物种的性极化来影响玉米的杂交，当然，在像人类这样的性极化物种中，雌雄同体个体可能很少出现。生物学上的异常，但这个词严格保留在解剖学上同时存在男性和女性性器官的情况下。夸张的反对或娱乐的语气：年轻人的发型变得越来越雌雄同体，即使在严格的生物学用途中也有一个更正式的环，当它更普遍地应用在这里时，听起来可能很深奥或好奇，但事实并非如此；因此很可能与生物结构相混淆：在这些文化中，除了生育等生物功能之外，性角色扮演相对是雌雄同体的。

Epicene has no relevance to biological classification whatever, referring strictly to someone who in appearance or attitudes unites qualities of both sexes: a large, puffy face with soft features that were strikingly epicene in appearance. The word usually carries a disapproving or at least negative tone. Unlike bisexual, epicene may not refer to activity at all and may in fact suggest someone who appears sexless or is marked by no strong characteristics of either sex. In a culture that places a high value on manliness, epicene can often refer to effeminacy in men or even to neurasthenic male qualities: cultural stereotypes of the virile warrior and the epicene intellectual.

无论如何，Epicene 与生物分类无关，严格指的是在外表或态度上结合了两性特质的人：一张大而浮肿的脸，有着柔和的特征，在外观上引人注目。这个词通常带有不赞成或至少是负面的语气。与双性恋不同，epicene 可能根本不指活动，实际上可能暗示某人看起来无性别或没有明显的性别特征。在高度重视男子气概的文化中，epicene 通常可以指男性的女性气质。甚至神经衰弱的男性特质：男性武士和史诗知识分子的文化刻板印象。

SEE: FEMININE, MASCULINE.


4.87 Bitterness
These words refer to a caustic, sharp or rancorous temper or manner. Bitterness can indicate, most generally, a gloomy, dour or cold disposition, but its special connotations suggest a deep-seated rage directed inwards more than an anger directed at others, with disillusion or a conviction of injustice as its possible source and a smouldering cynicism as its possible result: lifelong bitterness at losing the woman he loved. Sourness is less intense than bitterness but suggests somewhat the same dour manner with an inward-directed disillusion as its source: What was sourness in Hamlet’s view of the world has deepened to bitterness in Timon’s. On the other hand, sourness, unlike bitterness, might suggest an external appearance only: a cheerful disposition that belied the sourness of her wrinkled face. Harshness relates more to manner than to disposition, suggesting not so much rancour as cruelty, either deliberate or unintentional: a teacher who met every infraction of the rules with harshness. Harshness, however, might merely be employed as a tactic: trying to soften his will first with wheedling, then with harshness.


这些词指尖酸刻薄、尖锐或充满敌意的脾气或举止，最常见的是，苦毒可以表示阴沉、阴沉或冷酷的性格，但其特殊含义表明一种根深蒂固的内心愤怒，而不是针对他人的愤怒。幻灭或对不公正的信念是其可能的根源，而闷烧的愤世嫉俗则是其可能的结果：失去他所爱的女人而终生的痛苦。 ：哈姆雷特的世界观中的酸涩在丁满的世界观中加深为苦涩。另一方面，酸涩与苦涩不同，可能只表明一种外在表现：一种开朗的性格，相信她布满皱纹的脸的酸涩更多地与她有关。态度而不是性情，与其说是仇恨，不如说是残酷，无论是有意还是无意：然而，严厉对待每一次违反规则的老师可能只是一种策略：首先试图通过哄骗来软化他的意志。 ，然后严厉地。

The remaining words have a greater degree of formality than the foregoing. Acerbity relates most closely to sourness, suggesting an acidity of attitude that might, however, be expressed by a more directly sharp manner than with sourness: the abrupt acerbity with which he countered our every attempt at a casual conversation. Asperity relates most closely to harshness, with special emphasis on roughness or severity of treatment; implying even an arbitrary unevenness of disposition: the bewildering asperity of a governess who first ignored his questions and then punished him for asking them. Acrimony relates most closely to bitterness, but with a more outwardly directed rancour implied, even to the point of biting, irritating and enraged actions: trying to make peace in a charged atmosphere clouded by acrimony.

其余的词比前面的词具有更大程度的正式性，与酸味最密切相关，暗示着一种酸涩的态度，然而，这种态度可以通过比酸味更直接尖锐的方式来表达：他用突然的尖刻来反驳我们的观点。随意交谈的每一次尝试都与粗暴密切相关，特别强调粗暴或严厉的对待，甚至暗示着一种任意的不平衡性情：一位家庭教师首先忽视他的问题，然后因为他提出问题而惩罚他；尖刻与苦毒关系最密切，但隐含着一种更外在的怨恨，甚至达到咬人、激怒和愤怒行为的地步：试图在尖酸刻薄的紧张气氛中实现和平。

4.88 Bizarre
These words refer to anything that is thought extremely strange, eccentric, unusual, abnormal, ugly or deformed. Bizarre points to the strange and unusual when they cause shock or surprise because of the unexpected, incongruous or sensational forms they assume: skyscrapers that were as bizarre to him as his village of mud huts would have been to us; the flamboyant gothic style in which the stonework of the arches and windows took on bizarre convoluted designs. Grotesque suggests more readily the eccentric or deformed when seen as a comic or horrible caricature of some norm: Falstaff and the other grotesque cronies of the young prince; children with grotesque, cadaverous bodies, blighted by disease and malnutrition.

这些词指的是任何被认为极其奇怪、古怪、不寻常、不正常、丑陋或畸形的东西，因为它们呈现出意想不到的、不协调的或耸人听闻的形式，从而引起震惊或惊讶，比如摩天大楼。对他来说，他的土屋村对我们来说是很奇怪的；华丽的哥特式风格，拱门和窗户的石雕呈现出奇异而复杂的设计，当被视为滑稽或可怕的漫画时，更容易暗示出古怪或变形。一些规范：福斯塔夫和年轻王子的其他怪异亲信；身体怪异、苍白的孩子，受到疾病和营养不良的折磨。

Fantastic is more general and less concrete than the previous words. It can be used of anything that is fanciful or dreamlike or that appears as a departure from common-sense reality: the fantastic nightmare world of Hieronymous Bosch; a fantastic tower made of concrete, bottles, hubcaps and cans. The word is over-used as a hyperbole for anything pleasant, good or out of the ordinary. Weird is similar to fantastic in suggesting a harp break from ordinary reality: a weird feeling that time was standing still as the car hurtled down the cliff; weird forms of ocean life that live where sunlight never reaches them. This word, too, is over-used as a hyperbole for anything mildly unusual. Outlandish once suggested behaviour typical of people on the periphery of a cultural centre; now it more commonly suggests anything that is unusual to the point of shock or outrage: the outlandish dress of the pop singer; disgusted by their outlandish manners.

与前面的词相比，“幻想”更笼统，更不具体，它可以用于任何幻想或梦幻般的事物，或者看起来与常识现实背道而驰的东西：希罗尼姆斯·博斯的梦幻般的噩梦世界；一座由混凝土制成的梦幻般的塔楼；这个词被过度用作夸大任何令人愉快的、美好的或不同寻常的东西，就像暗示竖琴脱离平凡现实一样：一种时间静止的奇怪感觉。汽车冲下悬崖；生活在阳光照射不到的地方的奇怪的海洋生物，这个词也被过度用作夸张，用来描述文化中心外围人们的典型行为。现在，它更常见地暗示任何不寻常到令人震惊或愤怒的事物：流行歌手的古怪着装，对他们古怪的举止感到厌恶。

Way-out and far-out are current fad words for anything that represents a sharp departure from the norm. Most often, they are used as approving hyperboles for anything out of the ordinary: a marvellous, way-out party. These words are often used in descriptions of avant-garde art or the rebellious nonconformity of young people.

“出路”和“出路”是当前流行的词语，用来形容任何与常态截然不同的事物。最常见的是，它们被用作对任何不寻常事物的认可夸张：一个奇妙的、出路的聚会。用于描述前卫艺术或年轻人的叛逆不墨守成规。

4.89 Bland
These words refer to taste, odours and other sensations that are unassertive in character. Bland is the most specific of these, referring most appropriately to food that has not been heavily spiced: The doctor recommended a bland, salt-free diet for the patient. In other uses, the word may refer similarly to something of even disposition, without extremes, or lacking in tension: the bland domestic atmosphere in the house, free of argument or petty bickering; a bland, hazy spring day, neither too warm nor too cool. While these uses give a positive connotation, the word can become negative in tone when it suggests a lack of desirable excitement, flavour or interest: the bland, anonymous cooking of the English; a bland novel that I began but couldn’t finish; the bland attitude of many lowland farmers despite the flood warning.

这些词指的是味道、气味和其他不自信的感觉，“平淡”是其中最具体的，最适合指没有加太多香料的食物：医生建议患者吃清淡、无盐的饮食。在其他用途​​中，这个词也可以指性格平和、没有极端或缺乏紧张的事物：房子里温和的家庭气氛，没有争论或琐碎的争吵；一个温和、朦胧的春日，既不太温暖也不太太热。虽然这些用法给出了积极的含义，但当它暗示缺乏令人向往的兴奋、风味或兴趣时，这个词的语气可能会变得消极：平淡无奇的英语烹饪，我开始但无法完成的平淡小说；尽管有洪水警告，许多低地农民的态度却很温和。

Moderate is more neutral in tone than bland, being simply descriptive of a middle ground between extremes, without necessarily suggesting a positive or negative evaluation: a moderate winter and summer; amoderate conservative. Juxtaposed with a bad extreme, however, the word can give an approving tone: a reign that was thought moderate and tolerant after the blood-baths of the previous ruler. Both gentle and mild suggest an avoidance of extremes, but with a more forthrightly approving tone than moderate has. Gentle suggests a slight use of force to gain a result or a tender consideration for someone else: a gentle breeze of the patio; a gentle way of reprimanding her son. Unlike gentle, mild does not point to restrained power or considerate behaviour so much as it indicates something thoroughly without harshness by its very nature: mild autumn weather; mild suburban faces. Like bland, however, mild can suggest something so toned-down as to be uninteresting or unexciting: a comedy that offers only mild amusement; disclosures that were mild compared to those still forthcoming. The negative tone here is still far less intense or thoroughgoing than is true for bland.
	
温和的语气比平淡更中性，只是描述极端之间的中间立场，不一定表示积极或消极的评价：温和的冬天和夏天；然而，与糟糕的极端并列，这个词可以给出一种温和的感觉。赞成的语气：在前任统治者的血腥洗礼之后，一种被认为是温和和宽容的统治。温和和温和都表明避免极端，但比温和更直率的赞成语气表明稍微使用武力。为别人赢得一个结果或温柔的体贴：庭院里的微风轻柔地训斥她的儿子，与温柔不同，温和并不意味着克制的权力或体贴的行为，而是表明了某种完全不严厉的东西。非常自然：温和的秋天天气；温和的郊区面孔，然而，温和可以暗示一些平淡无奇或不令人兴奋的东西：与即将上映的喜剧相比，它只提供温和的娱乐。这里的负面语气仍然远不如平淡的语气强烈或彻底。

Soothing is the most positive in tone of all these words. Something might be gentle or mild and still not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, soothing suggests sensations that are positively comforting, helpful or healing, either by the removal of irritation or by the application of something to overcome it: listening to the soothing silence; soothing ointment to relieve her sunburn. Dull compares strikingly with soothing in suggesting the complete absence of anything pleasurable. As such, is almost exclusively stresses, and with greater force, possibilities inherent in bland or mild: a dull evening playing cards with the neighbours; dull meals completely lacking in zest. Dull may of course apply more descriptively, like moderate, to low-key sensations: a dull grey sky; an artist who tended to use a palette of dull, subtly shaded colours.

舒缓是所有这些词中最积极的语气，有些东西可能是温和的，但仍然不一定有益，相反，舒缓意味着通过消除刺激或应用来积极地安慰、有帮助或治愈的感觉。克服它的方法：聆听舒缓的沉默；缓解晒伤的舒缓药膏与暗示完全没有任何愉快的事物的舒缓相比，几乎完全是压力，并且具有更大的力量，平淡或温和的可能性。温和：与邻居打牌的沉闷的夜晚；完全缺乏热情的沉闷的饭菜 沉闷的当然可以更描述性地适用于低调的感觉：沉闷的灰色天空；倾向于使用沉闷调色板的艺术家； ，微妙的阴影颜色。

4.90 Break
These words refer to intervals during which some activity stops or slackens. Break and spell stress the idea of interruption. They indicate a temporary time-out, as from work, for rest, refreshment, recreation or other purpose: a coffee break. Spell is a little more colloquial and is not qualified: Have a spell when you are tired. Pause is less abrupt and drastic, indicating a brief rest or a momentary suspension of action: the pause that refreshes. A scheduled interruption of a radio or TV programme that is called a station break at the studio is referred to in milder terms on the air as a pause for station identification. Pause is also used to stress the temporary nature of a cease-fire: a pause in the bombing; Government sources said there would be no prolonged pause in the war. Respite is a much more formal synonym for break. A respite is an interval of relief, as from some source of train: ceaseless toil that knows no respite; the holiday truce was a welcome respite for the front-line troops. One takes a break or has a spell but is granted a respite: The workmen took a break so we enjoyed a brief respite from the noise.	

这些词指的是某些活动停止或放松的时间间隔，它们表示暂时的暂停，用于休息、茶点、娱乐或其他目的：喝咖啡休息。 Spell 更通俗一点，没有限定条件： Pause 不那么突然和剧烈，表示短暂的休息或暂时的暂停：收音机或电视的预定中断。被称为“演播室暂停”的节目在播出时被称为“暂停”，因为“暂停”也被用来强调停火的临时性质：政府消息人士称，暂停轰炸；战争中不会有长时间的停顿，休息是休息的一个更正式的同义词，就像来自某种火车的休息一样：无休无止的劳作对于假期休战来说是一个受欢迎的休息。前线部队休息或休息一段时间，但得到了喘息的机会：工人们休息了，所以我们享受了远离噪音的短暂喘息。

A recess is an interval between the sessions of a school, court, legislature or the like. It implies a formal adjournment for a limited time, with a temporary suspension of business: The committee had a short recess; a legislative recess before elections.

休会是指学校、法院、立法机关等会议之间的间歇期，它意味着在有限时间内正式休会，并暂时停止工作：委员会在选举前有短暂休会；课间休息可能短如休息，也可能长如假期，但它以某种官方授权为前提[演员们决定休会；法官宣布休息两小时。] 在学校，课间休息是一种休息时间。课堂之间的空闲时间，孩子们可以玩耍、放松或吃点东西：男孩们在课间休息时玩弹珠。

An interlude is a period or episode that occurs in the course of a longer process and breaks its continuity: noise with interludes of quiet. By nature, an interlude contrasts with the activity it interrupts or the events it comes between ?often occurring as an interval of calm, a time of content or a touch of comic relief: interludes of lucidity in his delirium; a humorous interlude in a sober history; Their honeymoon was an idyllic interlude. Intermission and interval are synonyms for a scheduled recess between the acts of a play or the parts of a performance: to go out for a smoke during intermission. Interlude, on the other hand, may apply to an entertainment of a different kind that fills a break between the acts, as a brief, farcical comedy or a short, transitional passage of music: an orchestral interlude. In another sense, intermission may apply to any temporary cessation: The noise went on without intermission.

间奏是在一个较长的过程中发生的一段或一段插曲，它打破了它的连续性：从本质上讲，间奏与它中断的活动或它之间发生的事件形成鲜明对比——通常作为一个间隔发生。平静的时光，一段满足的时光或一丝喜剧般的轻松：他的谵妄中的清醒的插曲；清醒的历史中的幽默插曲；他们的蜜月是一段田园诗般的插曲，是一场演出之间预定的休息的同义词。戏剧或表演的一部分：在幕间休息时出去抽烟，另一方面，插曲可能适用于填补表演之间休息的不同类型的娱乐，如简短的滑稽喜剧或短片。 ，音乐的过渡段落：管弦乐间奏 在另一种意义上，间歇可以适用于任何暂时的停止：噪音不间断地继续。

Let-up is an informal word and is usually used negatively after no or without. It often indicates abatement rather than cessation, pointing to a lessening of force, a slackening of pace or a reduction in number or intensity. [The rain poured down without let-up; We’ve worked two hours without let-up; There has been no let-up in the stream of complaints.] Lull designates an interval of stillness or calm that contrasts with prior and subsequent noise or confusion: a lull in a storm. Lull may also refer to a falling off of activity, implying a loss of momentum and suggesting the sluggishness of a slack period: a lull in business; a lull in the conversation.

Let-up 是一个非正式用词，通常在 no 或 without 之后使用，通常表示减弱而不是停止，表示力量的减弱、速度的放慢或数量或强度的减少。停顿；我们已经工作了两个小时，没有停顿；抱怨的声音没有停歇。风暴也可能指活动的减少，暗示动力的丧失，并暗示淡季的低迷：生意的平静；谈话的平静。


4.91 Bleak
These words refer to people or things that look wasted or inhospitable. Bleak is the most general of these and can apply equally well to people or things, especially landscapes or houses. It suggests a bare or unpleasant prospect: the bleak, ice-encrusted mountains of the Andes; the bleak, unpainted house that seemed almost uninhabitable. Used of people, it suggests a facial expression that is unhappy or unfriendly: She gave her husband a bleak, unsatisfied look. It can, of course, suggest anything unhopeful or unpromising: their one bleak hope for survival.

Gaunt and haggard are more closely tied to the physical appearance of people. Gaunt stresses leanness but it may or may not suggest a wasted or shrunken appearance: the sailor’s gaunt, weather-beaten face. Haggard, however, insists on emaciation or at very least suggests a drawn expression resulting from strain or shock: the haggard faces of the prisoners in the concentration camp; a face haggard with grief. Gaunt can also apply to things or landscapes, in which case it suggests a harsh or bare scene: the gaunt moors of the Brontë country. In this context, bleak is more intense than gaunt: grateful for even the gaunt plains after the bleak wasteland of the desert. Haggard would sound less natural in describing anything other than people, but used metaphorically, it might suggest a worn, run-down appearance: the rows of haggard houses that testified to poverty and neglect.

憔悴和憔悴与人们的外貌关系更密切，但它可能会也可能不会暗示一种消瘦或萎缩的外观：然而，水手的憔悴、饱经风霜的脸却坚持憔悴或至少是憔悴的。表示由于紧张或震惊而造成的紧张表情：集中营中囚犯的憔悴面孔；憔悴的表情也可以适用于事物或风景，在这种情况下，它表示严酷或光秃秃的场景：憔悴的荒原。在勃朗特国家的背景下，“荒凉”比“荒凉”更强烈：在描述荒凉的沙漠荒原之后，即使是对荒凉的平原表示感激，在描述除了人之外的任何事物时，它可能会显得不太自然。破旧、破败的外观：一排排因贫困和忽视而苦恼的破旧房屋。

Desolate and barren refer to uninhabitable or unfeatured landscape. Desolate suggests an underpopulated starkness, barren a complete absence of life: only a few farmhouses strung out over the desolate countryside; barren rocks where the smallest shrub could find no foothold. Desolate can, however, also suggest solitariness or friendlessness: a desolate pine or two struggling for life above the timber line: a girl left desolate in the strange city.

4.92 Blithe
These words refer to a pleasant, warm, cheerful or high-spirited	disposition or manner. Blithe indicates an attitude that is cheerful,mirthful, joyous or gay: blithe crowds enjoying the sunny weather in the park. The word can have a less favourable application to a manner that is casual, indifferent or airy, particularly when directed towards something that should be taken seriously: listening to my grievance with a blithe lack of concern.	

这些词指的是令人愉快的、热情的、开朗的或昂扬的性格或举止。 Blithe 表示一种开朗、快乐、快乐或快乐的态度：愉快的人群在公园里享受阳光明媚的天气。以一种随意、冷漠或轻率的方式，特别是当针对应该认真对待的事情时：以一种无忧无虑、漠不关心的态度倾听我的不满。

Genial points to a more low-key or long-term good-humoured attitude that is exhibited in a kindly, pleasant or warm manner; it suggests an unruffled or even temper and an ability to put people at ease: an extremely genial host. Light-hearted is closer in tone to blithe, since it suggests an absence of care or a positive state of buoyant delight: light-hearted youngsters singing as the hiked through the bush. A contrast of how one feels, whereas the very essence of light-hearted is its suggestion of a spontaneous welling up of high spirits. Genial, furthermore, suggests friendly relationships with others; light-hearted may pertain to someone completely alone.

和蔼是指一种比较低调或长期幽默的态度，以一种和善、愉快或温暖的方式表现出来；它表示一种不慌不忙甚至脾气暴躁、能让人放松的能力：一个极其和蔼可亲的主人。 -heart 的语气更接近 blithe，因为它暗示着一种无忧无虑的状态或一种积极的快乐状态：轻松愉快的年轻人在徒步穿过灌木丛时唱歌，与一个人的感受形成鲜明对比，而 light 的本质是——愉快的暗示着自发的兴高采烈，此外，愉快的暗示可能与完全孤独的人有关。

Convivial serves as an intensification of genial, suggesting jolly sociability and warm fellow-feeling; its Latin root pertains to a feast or banquet and this is often reflected in the English use of the word: convivial merrymakers at the carnival. Jovial may suggest sociability, but it is less specific in indicating any sort of good-natured amiability. The word is very often used to describe a jolly but dignified fat man, so much so that the word is sometimes taken to specify this situation. Similarly, blithe sometimes suggests a spry, elfin or fey person, particularly a woman.

Convivial 是 genial 的强化，暗示快乐的社交和温暖的同胞感觉；它的拉丁词根与盛宴或宴会有关，这通常反映在该词的英语用法中：convivial merrymakers at the carnival 可能暗示社交，但它不太具体地表示任何种类的善良和蔼可亲，这个词经常被用来描述一个快乐但有尊严的胖子，以至于有时这个词被用来指定这种情况。敏捷、精灵或怪异的人，尤其是女人。

Elated an ebullient both refer, like light-hearted, to a welling up of high spirits. Elated, however, can often refer to a response to some external occurrence or news, whereas ebullient suggests the same spontaneity as light-hearted. Ebullient stems from the root of a Latin word meaning to boil out, and the English word reflects this in pointing to a bubbling over with enthusiasm, excitement or exuberance: fans who were elated when the team scored another goal; an ebullient personality that always seemed to overflow with vivacity and zest.

兴高采烈和热情洋溢一样，都指兴高采烈，然而，兴高采烈通常可以指对某些外部事件或新闻的反应，而热情洋溢则表示与轻松愉快的根源相同的自发性。拉丁语中的单词意为“沸腾”，英语单词则反映了热情、兴奋或热情的沸腾：当球队再次进球时兴高采烈的球迷；热情洋溢的个性，似乎总是洋溢着活力和热情。 。

4.93 Blockhead
These words are all informal pejoratives for people who behave in stupid or foolish ways. Blockhead, dolt and dunce suggest foolish behaviour that results from a lack of intelligence. Blockhead suggests a dense, slow-witted person who predictably misunderstands information or is filled with exasperatingly obvious ideas or attitudes: a party at which he talked with one insufferable blockhead after another. Dolt specifically suggests a lack of flair, imagination or perception that results from cloddish conventionality: dolts in the audience who liked her medley of show-tunes better than her group of Schubert songs. Dunce may suggest a momentary failure of intelligence rather than a permanent lack of it: He made a dunce of himself by forgetting the name of the guest of honour.

这些词都是对行为愚蠢的人的非正式贬义词，“傻瓜”和“傻瓜”表示由于缺乏智力而做出的愚蠢行为。明显的想法或态度：在一次聚会上，他与一个又一个令人难以忍受的傻瓜交谈，特别表明了由于粗俗的传统而缺乏天赋、想象力或感知力：观众中的傻瓜比她更喜欢她的表演曲调。邓斯的一组舒伯特歌曲可能暗示着智力的暂时失败，而不是永久的缺乏：他忘记了主宾的名字，从而自取其辱。

Fool, idiot and chump need not suggest a lack of intelligence. All can suggest silly or ridiculous behaviour that arises from any number of causes: letting the woman make a fool of him; don’t be an idiot ?accept the offer of a new job. Chump, besides being a much more informal substitute for fool, can indicate somebody who allows himself to be come the butt of a joke or confidence game: looking for chumps who could be lured into buying worthless share certificates. Chump can also be a severely contemptuous term for any sort of unsophiscated or ordinary person: chumps dumb enough to be taken in by sensational journalism. Like a chump or a fool, a dill is easily taken in or can usually be relied on to do the stupid or naive thing: a bit of a dill, the way he always lets others take advantage of him.

“傻瓜”、“白痴”和“笨蛋”并不意味着缺乏智慧，所有这些都可以暗示由多种原因引起的愚蠢或可笑的行为：让女人愚弄他，不要成为白痴？接受新的提议。 “Cump”除了是“傻瓜”的更非正式的替代品之外，还可以表示一个让自己成为笑话或信任游戏的笑柄的人：寻找可能被引诱购买毫无价值股票的傻瓜也可以是一个“傻瓜”。对任何不成熟或普通人的严重蔑视的术语：愚蠢到被耸人听闻的新闻所欺骗的人，像傻瓜或傻瓜一样，很容易被欺骗或通常可以依靠做愚蠢或天真的事情：有点莳萝，他总是让别人利用他。

The remaining group of words relates to the last suggestion of chump and dill in indicating contempt for ordinary or simple people. When it is not an informal substitute for fool, boob suggests a heavy, stupid person. Nincompoop has particular relevance in describing a foolish man, suggesting a weakling afflicted by timidity and passivity: situation comedies that stereotype husbands as bumbling nincompoops. Ninny can apply to either sex, but may be particularly useful in reference to foolish women, suggesting silly, precious or prissy behaviour: a ninny who wrote saccharine poems about butterflies and daffodils.

剩下的一组词与最后一个词“chump”和“dill”有关，表示对普通人或简单人的蔑视。当它不是“傻瓜”的非正式替代品时，“boob”表示“笨重的、愚蠢的人”，在描述一个愚蠢的人时特别相关。 ，暗示受胆怯和被动折磨的弱者：将丈夫刻板印象为笨手笨脚的傻瓜的情景喜剧可以适用于任何性别，但可能对愚蠢的女性特别有用，暗示愚蠢，珍贵或拘谨的行为：一个写糖精的傻瓜。关于蝴蝶和水仙花的诗。

4.94 Bloody
These words refer to the spilling of blood or to an attitude that delights in bloodshed. Bloody suggests freshly spilt blood or conflict that results in heavy casualties: the bloody hands of the suspect; the bloody, four-day battle. It is also frequently used as an epithet for someone or something responsible for wanton slaughter: the bloody Stalinist purges; Hitler’s bloody henchmen; Bloody Mary. Bloody has come to be used as a curse word for anything displeasing. This use was once taken as a blasphemous reference to Christ’s blood, but over-use has weakened its force: He cursed the bloody tricycle he had tripped over in the dark. Gory, by contrast, suggests clotted or dried blood: police photographing the gory knife. It may also refer to any production that revels in giving extremely detailed accounts of gruesome accidents or murders: a gory detective story. This use also appears in the cliché, the gory details, which suggests the loving and minute description of anything unpleasant.

这些词指的是流血或以流血为乐的态度，血腥意味着新鲜的流血或造成重大伤亡的冲突：嫌疑人的血淋淋的双手；血腥的、持续四天的战斗。作为对肆意屠杀的某人或某物的绰号：血腥的斯大林主义清洗；血腥玛丽已被用作任何令人不快的事物的咒语。 ，但过度使用削弱了它的力量：相比之下，他诅咒了他在黑暗中绊倒的血淋淋的三轮车，血腥意味着凝结或干涸的血液：警察拍摄的血腥刀也可能指任何陶醉于其中的作品。对可怕的事故或谋杀进行极其详细的描述：血腥的侦探故事也出现在陈词滥调中，血腥的细节，暗示对任何不愉快的事情的爱和细致的描述。

The remaining words apply primarily to an eagerness to let blood, either literally or figuratively. Bloodthirsty is most specific here, suggesting a delight in inflicting harm on others, especially in armed combat: bloodthirsty generals who urged the king to declare war; bloodthirsty guerillas intent on terrorizing the native villagers. The word can also be used figuratively to describe people who enjoy reading or seeing accounts of bloody happenings: bloodthirsty audiences who dote on gory television dramas.

其余的词主要适用于渴望流血，无论是字面意思还是比喻意义上的嗜血在这里最为具体，暗示着对他人造成伤害的快乐，尤其是在武装战斗中：嗜血的将军敦促国王宣战，嗜血的游击队意图。这个词也可以用来比喻那些喜欢阅读或观看血腥事件的人：喜爱血腥电视剧的嗜血观众。

Sanguinary is considerably more formal than these other words, giving a literary, almost euphemistic substitute for bloody or bloodthirsty: the sanguinary oppression of the conquered nation. It may also be used merely to refer to someone in a foul temper or ugly frame of mind: a sanguinary disposition.

血腥比这些其他词要正式得多，它是血腥或嗜血的文学，几乎是委婉的替代品：被​​征服国家的血腥压迫它也可以仅用来指脾气暴躁或思想丑陋的人：嗜血的性格

In specific comparison with the other words, a blow is a forceful hit with the fist: The fighter felled his opponent with a mighty blow. Punch is a more informal word than blow; and, unlike blow, it is limited in application. A punch is a quick, short blow or jab with the fist, typically aimed at a particular target: a punch in the eye. Punch is a boxing term: to throw a punch; to land a punch; to roll with a punch. A boxer dazed by repeated blows to the head is referred to as punch-drunk. Outside the ring, punch often suggests a belligerent attitude, the desire to pick a fight: I’m going to give you a punch in the nose.

And a slap on the back is a hearty, friendly, man-to-man form of greeting or congratulations.

打耳光是用张开的手或用扁平的东西猛烈地打在脸上，通常是为了责备；她的约会对象开始变得新鲜，她打了他一巴掌。用手套打脸是一种蓄意的侮辱，因此一个人向另一个人发起决斗，但打脸可以让某人从歇斯底里中惊醒，而打背则是一个热心、友善的人。 - 对人的问候或祝贺。

Cuff once could mean a blow with the fist, a usage that survives in the word fisticuffs; but now a cuff is usually a sidelong blow with the open hand or a cushioned slap with a paw: The mother cat gave her kitten a cuff. A box may be struck with the palm or fist, but where cuff stresses the type of blow, box emphasizes the part of the body that is hit ?the ear, cheek or side of the head. Both box and cuff are specifically applied to a slap on the ear, a punishment that was part of the schoolhouse discipline of an earlier era: to give an unruly boy a cuff (or a box) on the ear.
	
Cuff 曾经意味着用拳头击打，这种用法在“拳头”一词中得以保留；但现在，“cuff”通常是张开的手侧击或用爪子拍打：母猫给了她的小猫一个“A”拳头。 box 可以用手掌或拳头击打，但 cuff 强调击打的类型，box 强调击打的身体部位 - 耳朵、脸颊或头部侧面。 box 和 cuff 都专门适用于打耳光。打耳朵，这是早期校舍纪律的一部分的惩罚：给不守规矩的男孩打耳朵上的手铐（或盒子）。

A rap is a sharp, quick blow and a knock is a harder, heavier one. Both may be made with the knuckles, and both make sounds that signal a person’s presence: an insistent knock at the door; a light rap on the window pane. But a rap may also be administered with an implement as a mild form of punishment, and in this case the knuckles may receive the blow rather than striking it: The teacher gave him a rap on the knuckles with her ruler. Figuratively, to take the rap is to accept punishment for some failure or misdeed. Knock as a noun suggests the physical punishment of a fight only in a figurative sense: the school of hard knocks. In a similar way, to take the knock is to be hard hit or responsible financially. Blow, punch, and slap are also used figuratively. A slap in the face is an insult, rebuke or slur. An editorial with punch has vitality and force. A blow is a calamity that hits the emotions with a sudden, forceful impact: His tragic death was a blow from which she never fully recovered.

4.96 Blush
All these words have uses to describe the change in a person’s facial appearance when he is embarrassed or under a strain. Blush is specifically restricted to the rushing of blood into the face of someone who is shocked or embarrassed: She blushed easily at any talk of bodily functions. It is more commonly used to describe a woman; a man who blushes might be thought effeminate. Colour is a less precise, almost euphemistic synonym for blush: the girl who coloured under his glance. When applied to a man, it might suggest an attempt to avoid the effeminacy implied in blush. In any case, because colour has so many other uses and can sound confusing in this context, it might best be avoided altogether.
	
所有这些词都用来描述一个人在感到尴尬或紧张时面部表情的变化。“脸红”专门限于震惊或尴尬的人脸上的血液涌上来：她在任何谈话中都很容易脸红。它更常用于形容女人；脸红的男人可能被认为是女性化的。颜色是脸红的一个不那么精确、几乎是委婉的同义词：当应用于男人时，它可能会被认为是女性。建议尝试避免腮红所暗示的女性化。无论如何，因为颜色有很多其他用途，并且在这种情况下听起来可能令人困惑，所以最好完全避免。

Flush, like colour, might be used in place of blush to avoid any note of effeminacy: his face flushing at the mere mention of her name. It is more commonly used, however, to refer to a feverish condition, either from illness, exertion or exposure: their faces flushed from hours of drill and callisthenics. Flush can also indicate emotional seizures other than embarrassment: a face flushed with anger; a crowd flushed with excitement.

Flush 和 color 一样，可以用来代替 blush，以避免任何女性化的感觉：他的脸一听到她的名字就泛红，然而，更常用的是指因疾病或劳累而发烧的情况。或暴露：他们的脸因数小时的训练和健美操而变红，这也可能表明除了尴尬之外的情绪发作：脸因愤怒而涨红；人群因兴奋而涨红。

Redden, like colour, can substitute for blush, but in being specific about the physical change involved, it sounds less euphemistic than colour. It also, like flush, can result from other emotional seizures: a scowl reddened by rage. Both redden and colour can, of course, describe skin changes outside the present context: a face reddened by long exposure to sun and wind; the skin slowly colouring from the sharp blow.

红色，像颜色一样，可以代替脸红，但具体到所涉及的身体变化，它听起来不像颜色那么委婉。它也像脸红一样，可能是由其他情绪发作引起的：因愤怒而变红的皱眉。当然，可以描述当前环境之外的皮肤变化：由于长时间暴露在阳光和风中而变红的脸；由于猛烈的打击而慢慢变色的皮肤。

4.97 Boast
These words refer to feelings of self-congratulation. Boast may suggest justifiable self-satisfaction: a college that boasts an unusually high number of distinguished Old Boys. More often, however, the word suggests a self-important and tasteless pointing out of one’s own successes: He monopolized the conversation by boasting of his own prowess at hunting and fishing; continually boasting and blowing his own horn. Occasionally the word can refer to self-congratulation for a victory not yet won: He boasted that he would finish off the challenger in the first round. Pride is close to the justified self-satisfaction possible for boast, but it more often specifically suggests private self-regard rather than a public expression of it; it is usually reflexive: He secretly prided himself on a life of absolute honesty. The word can suggest a stiff-necked self-righteousness or a faulty estimate of one’s own virtues: Priding himself on his democratic outlook, he nevertheless sent his children to a private school.
	
这些词指的是自我庆幸的感觉，可能暗示着一种合理的自我满足：一所拥有异常多的杰出老男孩的大学，然而，这个词更多的时候暗示着一种自以为是和无品味的指出。成功：他通过吹嘘自己在狩猎和钓鱼方面的能力来垄断谈话；不断地吹嘘和吹响自己的号角，这个词有时可以指对尚未赢得的胜利的自我庆贺：他吹嘘他会消灭挑战者。在第一轮中，骄傲接近于夸耀时可能出现的合理的自我满足，但它更经常地表明私人的自尊，而不是公开的表达；它通常是反射性的：他暗自为自己的绝对生活感到自豪。诚实这个词可能意味着顽固的自以为是或对自己美德的错误估计：他对自己的民主观点感到自豪，但还是把孩子送到了私立学校。

Brag intensifies the note of tastelessness in boast, suggesting limitless conceit and, possibly, inaccuracy of the claims being made: bragging about his imaginary exploits in the last war; bragging about his son’s success at school as a way of patting himself on the back. Crow suggests noisy or vociferous bragging of an extremely offensive kind after the event: publicly crowing about the defeat of his opponent. Gloat is an intensification of crow. Although it need not be verbal and sometimes suggests taunting someone that one has bested: rubbing his hands in secret and gloating over the way he had made the other applicants look foolish; gloating openly and lording it over those who had failed the examination.

吹牛强化了吹嘘中的无趣，暗示了无限的自负，而且可能还存在不准确的说法：吹嘘他在上次战争中想象中的功绩；吹嘘他儿子在学校的成功，以此作为一种自我表扬的方式。乌鸦暗示在比赛结束后进行一种极其无礼的大声吹嘘：公开吹嘘对手的失败是乌鸦的一种强化，尽管它不一定是口头的，有时还暗示着嘲笑被击败的人：搓手。暗中幸灾乐祸，让其他申请者显得愚蠢；公开幸灾乐祸，对那些考试不及格的人发号施令。

Strut suggests less animus than gloat but it is similar in not necessarily being verbal. It invariably suggests, however, an act done as a matter of public display: so puffed up and smug over his recent successes that he could not refrain from strutting about and preening himself before his fewer and fewer friends. Vaunt is considerably more formal than the other words here; it compares to the understandable self-satisfaction suggested by boast, but it is a shade more self-righteous, possibly suggesting a claim that cannot be substantiated. It differs from pride in usually implying a public expression of self-esteem: vaunting far and wide the cultural opportunities lying in wait for visitors to their small town.

斯特鲁特所暗示的不是敌意，而是幸灾乐祸，但它不一定是口头上的，但它总是暗示着一种公开展示的行为：对他最近的成功如此自负和沾沾自喜，以至于他无法克制地趾高气扬。在他越来越少的朋友面前炫耀自己比这里的其他词要正式得多，与夸耀所暗示的可以理解的自我满足相比，它更自以为是，可能暗示着一种无法证实的主张。它与骄傲不同，通常意味着公开表达自尊：到处炫耀等待游客来到小镇的文化机会。

4.98 Boil
These words all refer to methods of cooking by direct heat or flame, especially on to of a stove. Boil implies rapid cooking in more or less large quantities of water heated to the point (212° at sea level) where bubbles escape at the surface: to boil potatoes; to boil an egg.
	
这些词都是指通过直接加热或火焰进行烹饪的方法，尤其是在炉子上煮沸意味着在或多或少的大量水中快速烹饪，加热到气泡从表面逸出的程度（海平面212°）。 ：煮土豆；煮鸡蛋。

Simmer means to cook slowly in a hot liquid just below the boiling point, and usually for a long time.	

慢煮是指在略低于沸点的热液体中慢慢煮，通常要煮很长时间。

To steam food is to cook it by direct exposure to steam or by using heat generated by steam, as in a double boiler. Direct steaming is usually accomplished by placing a metal rack above the level of shallow boiling water in a pot so that the food does not touch the water: to steam fish; to steam vegetables. Poach implies a method of cooking a few foods, such as eggs without their shells, or pieces of chicken or fish, by dropping them into hot water, milk or stock and simmering until done.

蒸食物是通过直接暴露在蒸汽中或利用蒸汽产生的热量来烹饪食物，如在双层锅炉中，直接蒸通常是通过将金属架放置在锅中浅沸水的水平上方来完成的。不接触水：蒸鱼；蒸蔬菜是指将一些食物（例如去壳的鸡蛋、鸡肉或鱼块）放入热水、牛奶或高汤中煮沸的方法。直到完成。

Stew is a close synonym of simmer in that both mean to cook slowly in liquid over low heat; to stew prunes. However, to most people, stew strongly suggests the familiar dish that is cooked in this way -- meat combined with vegetables in a gravy or sauce. Stewing always involves simmering, but one may simmer (not stew) soups, vegetables, sauces, etc.

Stew 是 simmer 的近义词，因为两者都意味着用小火在液体中慢慢煮；然而，对于大多数人来说，stew 强烈暗示以这种方式烹饪的熟悉菜肴 - 将肉与蔬菜放在一起。肉汁或酱汁总是需要煨，但也可以煨（而不是炖）汤、蔬菜、酱汁等。

When cooks speak of stewing meat, they usually mean to braise it. Braise implies the browning of meat (and often of accompanying vegetables) in a small amount of fat prior to adding a stock or other liquid and simmering in a covered pan.

当厨师谈到炖肉时，他们通常指的是炖，即在加入高汤或其他液体并在有盖的平底锅中慢炖之前，将肉（通常还有伴随的蔬菜）煎成褐色。

Fry and sauté are closely related in that the food is cooked in hot fat. Sautéing, is done very quickly with a minimum amount of fat and may or may not imply browning. Meat is usually sautéed before it is braised. Frying suggests cooking in greater amounts of fat than that used in sautéing, and may be done in a pan containing up to one or two inches of fat or in a pot designed for deep frying, in which large amounts of fat are used. Dry-frying is the complete cooking of meat (chops, steak, etc.) by frying slowly in little or no fat. Foods, especially potatoes, cooked in deep fat until crisp are often called "French-fried."

煎和炒的密切相关之处在于，食物是用热油烹制的，用最少的脂肪很快就能完成，并且可能会或可能不会意味着肉在炖之前先煎一下。比煎炸中使用的脂肪量要多，并且可以在含有最多一或两英寸脂肪的平底锅中进行，或者在专为油炸而设计的锅中进行，其中使用大量的脂肪干煎是完整的烹饪。将肉（排骨、牛排等）在很少或没有脂肪的情况下慢慢煎炸 食物，尤其是土豆，在深油中烹制至酥脆，通常称为“法式油炸”。

One pot-roasts a large piece of meat by placing it in a little fat in a large saucepan on top of the stove, so that it cooks slowly, perhaps surrounded by roasting vegetables.

锅烤法是将一大块肉放入炉子顶部的大平底锅中，放入少许脂肪，慢慢地煮，周围可能还放着烤蔬菜。

4.99 Bold
These words share the connotation of self-assertive, confident and energetic dispositions, with or without a disregard for the rights of others. Bold shares with aggressive the implication of a vigorous attack on a problem or prosecution of one’s aims, and in this sense carries no derogatory connotation. An aggressive or bold entrepreneur will seek success farther afield and will risk more in this search than will his more timid competitor. Bold does, however, have a wider ranges of application than aggressive. In some contexts bold suggests impudence or cheekiness, although this use is certainly less common now than it once was: The bold fellow simply put out his hand and asked for more money. In other contexts it suggests commendable enterprise: a bold new venture in space science. Aggressive typically describes one who has a more lively sense of his own destiny than of other people’s feelings.

这些词都蕴含着自信、自信和精力充沛的性格，不管是否忽视他人的权利，“大胆”都含有积极攻击某个问题或追求自己目标的含义，从这个意义上讲，它具有积极进取的含义。没有贬义。 一个激进或大胆的企业家会比他胆小的竞争对手更远地寻求成功，但在某些情况下，“大胆”一词的应用范围更广。 ，尽管这种用法现在肯定不像以前那么常见了：大胆的家伙只是伸出手来要求更多的钱。在其他情况下，它暗示着值得称赞的事业：太空科学领域的大胆新冒险通常描述了一个人。对自己的命运比对其他人的感受有更强烈的认识。

Aggressive shares with forward and pushing a derogatory connotation of callousness in seeking one’s ends. A forward or pushing social climber may resort to gossip, slander and back-biting. Pushing may also be used in the less derogatory sense of aggressive to mean enterprising and energetic.

Aggressive 与forward 和 Pushing 具有贬义含义，表示在寻求自己的手段时冷酷无情。 一个前锋或推动的社交攀登者可能会说闲话、诽谤和中伤他人，Pushing 也可以用在不太贬义的意义上，表示积极进取和精力充沛。 。

4.100 Bombastic
These words are used to describe styles of speaking or writing. Bombastic and turgid are alike in designating a lack of restraint and discipline that so inflates the language used in a piece of writing or in a speech that its style and content are thrown out of balance. Bombastic is derived from the noun bombast which originally denoted the kind of cotton, wool or other soft material which is used for padding and stuffing. The suggestion of padding is very much present in any reference to a bombastic style which, though it does not always connote the complete absence of thought, certainly indicates an imbalance between the thought and the manner used to express it: For so trivial a topic, his speech was bombastic and cheaply theatrical. Turgid literally means swollen or distended, as by contained air or liquid: a healthy, turgid muscle; a leg turgid with infection. Like bombastic, turgid carries over a suggestion of its literal meaning into its figurative reference to style: a tiny idea which the author has blown up into this turgid, trying novel. Orotund is used positively to describe a full, clear, round and resonant tone of voice. The figurative sense of the word, however, is pejorative in its synonymity with bombastic. Orotund can apply to pompous, inflated speech or writing, but, because of its particular reference to sound, it is most often used to describe the spoken word: a speech so orotund as to cause yawns and whispers all over the auditorium. Purple, in the sense being compared here, means ornate or flowery. It is pejorative in its suggestion of too much colour and showiness: a good playwright who ruined some of his most dramatic moments with passages of bad poetry and purple prose. It also has come to refer to the erotic, the lurid, the vulgar or the profane: a TV compere whose interviews led to such purple exchanges that a sponsor demanded his dismissal.

这些词用来描述说话或写作的风格，它们都表示缺乏克制和纪律，以致文章或演讲中使用的语言过于夸张，以致其风格和内容失去平衡。 Bombastic 源自名词“bombast”，最初表示用于填充物和填充物的棉、羊毛或其他柔软材料。任何提及“夸张”风格的地方都经常出现填充物的暗示，尽管并不总是如此。意味着完全没有思想，当然表明了思想和表达它的方式之间的不平衡：对于如此琐碎的话题，他的演讲是夸夸其谈和廉价的戏剧性，“Turgid”字面意思是肿胀或膨胀，就像通过包含的空气或液体一样：健康、肿胀的肌肉；感染而肿胀的腿部。 就像夸夸其谈一样，“肿胀”将其字面意义带入了其对风格的比喻：作者在这部肿胀、尝试的小说中使用了一个微小的想法。积极地描述一种完整、清晰、圆润和洪亮的语气，然而，这个词的比喻意义是贬义的，它与夸夸其谈的同义词可以适用于浮夸、夸大的演讲或写作，但是，因为它的特殊指称。就声音而言，它最常用于描述口语：演讲声音如此响亮，以致在礼堂里引起哈欠和窃窃私语，在这里所比较的含义是华丽的或华丽的，它是贬义的。过多的色彩和浮夸：一位优秀的剧作家，用糟糕的诗歌和紫色散文毁掉了他最戏剧性的时刻。导致了如此紫色的交易，以至于赞助商要求解雇他。


4.101 Bony
These adjectives refer to extreme thinness in which the underlying bones are evident. Bony is the most general word and is relatively free of connotations. It simply indicates a prominent bone structure, whether this is deemed a sign of attractiveness, asceticism, chronic undernourishment or near-starvation: a crooner’s bony, boyish face; a waif-like actress with bony shoulders and big eyes; a bony Indian fakir; a bony, sway-backed nag. Bony is frequently applied to a single part of the body: long, bony fingers; bony knees. And it may sometimes emphasize attributes of bone that are not seen but felt, such as hardness or sharpness: She jabbed me with a bony elbow.
	
这些形容词指的是极度瘦弱，骨瘦如柴，是最通用的词，相对没有任何含义，它只是表示突出的骨骼结构，无论这是否被视为吸引力、禁欲主义、长期营养不良的标志。 -饥饿：歌手骨瘦如柴、孩子气的脸；瘦骨嶙峋的肩膀和大眼睛的流浪者；瘦骨嶙峋的印度苦行僧；瘦骨嶙峋的马驹经常出现在身体的某个部位：又长又瘦。有时，它可能会强调看不见但摸得着的骨头属性，例如硬度或锋利度：她用骨头肘部戳我。

Gaunt implies a paucity of flesh and prominence of bone. It comes from the Old Norse word for a tall, thin person and it indicates an angular leanness: the tall, gaunt figure of Don Quixote. Specifically, gaunt often calls to mind the haggard look of the hungry, anguished, ill or old. It suggests the weariness of long suffering or constant strain, describing one who seems to have been worn down to the bone: the gaunt, ascetic figure of a saint; a gaunt old man, hollow-eyed, with prominent cheekbones and attenuated limbs.

憔悴的意思是肌肉缺乏、骨骼突出，这个词源自古挪威语，意为高瘦的人，表示有棱有角的瘦削：具体来说，憔悴的形象常常让人想起憔悴的样子。它暗示着饥饿、痛苦、生病或年老的人的疲倦，形容一个人似乎已经疲惫不堪：一个憔悴的、苦行僧般的圣人形象；有眼睛，颧骨突出，四肢削薄。

Wasted implies a loss of flesh, stressing the cause of bony thinness. A wasted body is one that has been gradually consumed ?reduced to skin and bone by the ravages of time, grief, hunger or disease: wasted away by tuberculosis; a pallid face and wasted frame. Hence wasted implies physical weakness and frailty; the wasted form of a 100-year-old woman; a body wasted by disease.

消瘦意味着肌肉的流失，强调了骨骼瘦弱的原因，消瘦的身体是由于时间、悲伤、饥饿或疾病的蹂躏而逐渐消耗殆尽的身体：因肺结核而消瘦；因苍白的脸而消瘦。因此，“衰弱”意味着身体虚弱；百岁妇女的身体因疾病而衰弱。

Emaciated focuses on both the cause and the fact of abnormal leanness. It indicates a previous wasting away, implying the depletion of the body by grave illness, great suffering or terrible deprivation. Skeletal is the most extreme of all these words, pointing to the deathlike dominance of bone. Both skeletal and emaciated may suggest the leanness of living men who look like skeletons, their ribs and sharp bones showing through the skin: emaciated (or skeletal) survivors of a Nazi concentration camp. But skeletal has about it the further suggestion of something lifeless of unreal, not fully human or alive: a painting of skeletal men and women in a barren future world; a novelist whose characters seem to be skeletal symbols, thoroughly analysed but not fleshed out and never really brought to life. Emaciated, by contrast, is often expressive of human pity or horror at a skeletal appearance: the awful sight of emaciated children with distended bellies and glazed expressions.

“憔悴”既强调异常消瘦的原因，也强调其事实。它表示先前的消瘦，暗示身体因严重疾病、巨大痛苦或可怕的匮乏而耗尽。“骨骼”是所有这些词中最极端的，指的是死亡般的情况。骨骼占主导地位。 骨骼和瘦骨嶙峋都可能暗示着活生生的人看起来像骷髅，他们的肋骨和锋利的骨头透过皮肤显现出来：纳粹集中营的瘦弱（或骨骼）幸存者，但骨骼有进一步的暗示。一些没有生命的虚幻的东西，不完全是人性的或有生命的：一幅贫瘠的未来世界中骷髅男女的画作；一位小说家的人物似乎是骷髅符号，经过彻底的分析，但没有充实起来，也从未真正被赋予生命。相比之下，它通常表达人类对骨骼外观的怜悯或恐惧：瘦弱的儿童，腹部遥远，表情呆滞的可怕景象。

4.102 Boss
These words all refer to persons who are in authority over others. Boss is a colloquial word that originated in the United States and in its strictest sense applies to an employer, foreman or manger of a group of workmen. By extension it has also become a popular term for any executive, supervisor or immediate superior: the boss of a large clothing store. Boss may also apply to any person who is in control of things, whether by prerogative or by tyrannical behaviour. [A horse must understand who is boss; Many parents discover that a spoilt child has become boss of the household.]

这些词都指的是对他人有权威的人。 Boss 是一个起源于美国的口语词，严格意义上适用于一群工人的雇主、工头或经理。任何主管、主管或直接上级的通俗术语：大型服装店的老板也适用于任何控制事物的人，无论是通过特权还是通过专制行为。许多父母发现，一个被宠坏的孩子已经成为了家庭的老大。]

Chief, the most comprehensive of these words, can be applied to anyone who occupies the position of highest authority over a group, large or small: the editor in chief of a newspaper; the chief architect of the housing project. However, chief is more commonly used of the supervisor of some department of established government: a chief of staff; the chief inspector of weights and measures. Chief and boss are sometimes used interchangeably: I need my chief’s (or boss’s) signature on these contracts. In its original sense, a chief is the ruler of a primitive or nomadic tribe.

“酋长”这个词最全面，可以指在一个团体中担任最高权力的人，无论大小：报纸的主编；住房项目的总建筑师。常用于政府某些部门的主管：参谋长；首席度量衡员。有时可以互换使用：我需要我的主管（或老板）在这些合同上签字。 ，酋长是原始或游牧部落的统治者。

Head, like chief, is also a general term, but it is usually used of people who hold a more subordinate position than does a chief: the head of the telegraph office; the head of a boys?school; to be the head of one’s class.

Head 与 Chief 一样，也是一个通用术语，但通常用于比 Chief 地位低的人：电报局的负责人；男子学校的校长；班级。

A leader is one who is voluntarily followed because of an ability to guide and control others or because he has been chosen by a group or party to be its head. One tends to think of a leader’s having arrived at his position mainly because of his talent for influencing others and for acting as a guiding force: the leader of the German Reich; a leader in the fashion world; the leader of a labour movement.

领导者是因为有能力引导和控制他人，或者因为他被某个团体或政党选为领导者而自愿被追随的人。人们往往认为领导者之所以能达到他的地位，主要是因为他的才能。影响他人并发挥指导作用：德意志帝国的领导者；时尚界的领导者；劳工运动的领导者。

In its commonest sense a master is a person who has been given the authority to enforce obedience, but the word does not suggest the innate ability of the leader to guide and influence others. A master may be one who employs servants, is a male teacher at a school, or owns an animal, such as a dog, who can be trained to obey him. Master is also the formal title for the captain of a merchant ship. A teacher or leader in philosophy, religion, etc., who has followers or disciples is often called a master, as is Jesus by many Christians. Master is also applied to people of exceptional skill or artistic ability; a master plumber; the old masters of Renaissance painting; a master of the keyboard.

从最常见的意义上来说，主人是一个被赋予强制服从的权力的人，但这个词并不意味着领导者天生具有指导和影响他人的能力。主人可能是一个雇用仆人的人，是一位男老师。在学校里，或者拥有一只动物，比如狗，可以训练他们服从他。 大师也是对哲学、宗教等方面的老师或领导者的正式头衔。追随者或门徒通常被称为大师，正如许多基督徒所称的耶稣一样，大师也被称为水管工大师；文艺复兴时期的绘画大师。

Commander is narrower in its meaning than are the other words of this group. Originally, it meant one who commands, as a leader, chief, etc.; now it applies almost exclusively to highly placed personnel in the armed forces. In the Navy, a commander is an officer ranking next below a captain. The officer in charge of a military post is also called a commander, or commanding officer. The person holding supreme command of all the armed forces of a nation (as the Governor-General in Australia and New Zealand) is called a commander in chief, as is any high-ranking officer in charge of a fleet or a major force.

指挥官的含义比这个群体的其他词要窄，最初是指指挥者、领导者等，现在它几乎只适用于武装部队中的高级人员。指挥官是上尉以下的军官，负责军事职位的官员也称为指挥官或指挥官，负责指挥一个国家的所有武装部队（如澳大利亚的总督）。和新西兰）被称为总司令，就像任何负责舰队或主力部队的高级军官一样。

Maestro (from the Italian for master) is used of a person who is highly proficient in an artistic field; but it is now most often used of an eminent conductor, composer or performer in music. Maestro sometimes carries overtones of affectionate veneration, as in its application to the late Arturo Toscanini.

Maestro（来自意大利语，意为“大师”）用于指在艺术领域非常精通的人；但现在它最常用于音乐领域的杰出指挥家、作曲家或表演者，例如它适用于已故的阿图罗·托斯卡尼尼。

4.103 Bother
These words imply one of two situations: either one in which a person is actively annoying another or to a situation in which a person is upset by something not necessarily the actions of someone else. Some of these words can carry either the active or passive implication; other are mainly restricted to one sense or the other.

这些词暗示两种情况之一：一个人主动骚扰另一个人，或者一个人因某些不一定是其他人的行为而感到不安的情况，其中一些词可以带有主动或被动的含义。 ; 其他的主要局限于一种意义上或另一种意义上。
	
Bother, disturb and plague are often used in both active and passive senses. On the passive scale, bother usually indicates a minor complaint that may come and go: frequently bothered by a slight stiffness in his joints. Disturb is more intense, suggesting specifically, at its most extreme, mental derangement: the mentally disturbed delinquent. In milder uses, disturb points to a state of upset more thoroughgoing than that of bother: I was bothered by the lack of news at first, but now, after a month, I am really disturbed. Plague, in its passive sense, is perhaps the most intense of all these words, but suggests a specific kind of upset, one that repeatedly hammers inside the mind without pause. The person who is plagued ?by thoughts or by conditions around him ?is by implication in control neither of the things that hound or harry him nor of their recurrence within his possibly unstable mind: plagued by constant recollections of his long-dead wife; plagued by the odour in the packing plant; plagued by a continual lack of money.

打扰、打扰和瘟疫经常用于主动和被动的意义上，打扰通常表示可能会出现和消失的轻微抱怨：经常因关节轻微僵硬而烦恼，打扰更强烈，具体表明，在最极端的情况下，精神错乱：精神错乱的罪犯在较温和的用法中，扰乱指的是一种比烦扰更彻底的心烦意乱的状态：一开始我因缺乏消息而感到困扰，但现在，一个月后，我“我真的很不安”，从被动意义上来说，也许是所有这些词中最强烈的一个，但它暗示着一种特定的不安，一种不停顿地反复敲击着被思想或条件困扰的人的心灵。他周围的一切都暗示着既不控制那些困扰他的事物，也不控制它们在他可能不稳定的头脑中反复出现的情况：不断地回忆起他死去已久的妻子；受到包装厂里的气味的困扰；持续缺钱。

These same three words ?bother, disturb and plague ?give a somewhat different scale of effects in their active senses. In this case, disturb is the weakest in intensity. One person, for example, may disturb another unintentionally by actions not directed specifically to the latter: Did my whistling disturb you? Bother, here, is stronger than disturb, since an implication is present that the action may be done intentionally to disturb: Just pay the bill and I’ll stop bothering you. Plague is even stronger in the active voice than in the passive, suggesting repeated, deliberate annoyances that may have an almost demoniacal insistence: The bill collector plagued us with unrelenting phone calls, visits and threats.

同样的三个词“打扰”、“打扰”和“瘟疫”在其积极意义中给出了不同程度的影响，例如，一个人可能会因并非专门针对的行为而无意中打扰另一个人。后者：我的口哨打扰你了吗？在这里，打扰比打扰更强烈，因为存在暗示该行为可能是故意打扰的：只要付账，我就不再打扰你了。主动语态多于被动语态，暗示着重复的、故意的烦恼，可能有一种近乎恶魔般的坚持：收账人用无情的电话、拜访和威胁来困扰我们。

Trouble and worry are largely confined to the passive implication of being upset about something. [I am troubled by the doctor’s report; I’m worried that I’ll fail in the exam.] Both words are more forceful than the passive use of bother but less so than the same use of disturb. Trouble is slightly more formal than worry and suggests a definite cause for alarm; worry suggests less clear-cut reasons for uneasiness, specifically implying suspense over the outcome of something. Trouble is also more inclusive; one may be troubled without indulging in the helpless wasted motions of thought implied by worry.

麻烦和担忧很大程度上局限于对某事感到不安的被动暗示[我对医生的报告感到困扰；我担心我考试会失败。]这两个词都比被动使用的打扰更有力。但比同样使用“扰乱”的情况要少一些。“麻烦”比“担心”更正式，表示有明确的原因引起恐慌；“担心”表示不安的原因不那么明确，特别是表示对某件事的结果感到悬念。一个人可能会感到困扰，但不会沉迷于忧虑所暗示的无助的、浪费的思考动作。

In contrast, pester and harass are almost exclusively restricted to the active sense of someone annoying another person. [The platoon sergeant constantly harassed his men in ingeniously excruciating ways; Stop pestering me!] Both words are more forceful than the active use of disturb and even of bother. Pester is like the active use of plague in suggesting repeated and deliberate annoyances that interrupt someone else, but remains restricted mainly to trivial matters. Harass is considerably stronger, even carrying the possibility of physical punishment or worse: guerillas nightly harassing the border villages. Harass may even be stronger than plague in this case, since the latter stops short of any implication of physical violence.

相比之下，“pester”和“harass”几乎完全局限于某人骚扰另一个人的主动含义[排长不断地以巧妙而令人难以忍受的方式骚扰他的部下；别再缠着我了！]这两个词都比主动使用“干扰”和“干扰”更有力。即使是骚扰，也类似于积极使用瘟疫来暗示重复和故意打扰别人，但骚扰的程度要大得多，甚至可能带来体罚或更糟的情况：游击队每晚骚扰别人。在这种情况下，骚扰甚至可能比瘟疫更严重，因为没有任何人身暴力的影响。

4.104 Bounce
All these words describe ways in which the direction of a moving object can be radically changed. Bounce, the most general term, ban  be applied to virtually any missile that rebounds, such as a ball, stone, coin apple, etc. [He didn’t see me toss him the book; it bounced off his chest and fell to the floor.] But bounce commonly emphasizes resiliency. [The basketball bounced high in the air; My little girl loves to bounce up and down on her bed.]	
	
所有这些词都描述了可以从根本上改变移动物体方向的方式“反弹”，这是最通用的术语，几乎可以应用于任何反弹的导弹，例如球、石头、金苹果等。[他没有。我没看到我把书扔给他；它从他的胸口弹起，掉到了地板上。]但是弹跳通常强调弹性[篮球在空中弹得很高；我的小女孩喜欢在床上弹来弹去。 .]

Cannon is a curious word, because the noun refers to a highly skilful and carefully controlled billiards shot, whereas the verb often implies lack of control and recklessness. In billiards, a cannon is a shot in which the cue ball strikes against two other balls in succession. As a verb, cannon means to hit and rebound, often in a context that implies that the rebound is uncontrolled and damaging. [The car cannoned off the telephone pole and hurtled into a parked mail van.]

Cannon 是一个奇怪的词，因为这个名词指的是一种高度熟练且精心控制的台球击球，而动词则通常意味着缺乏控制和鲁莽。在台球中，cannon 是指母球撞击另外两个球的击球。作为动词，“大炮”的意思是“撞击和反弹”，通常在暗示反弹不受控制且具有破坏性的情况下[汽车从电线杆上轰出，冲进一辆停着的邮车。]

Deflect means to turn aside or cause something to swerve from its course. Ricochet means to glance from a surface in the fashion of a stone thrown over the surface of water, making a series of skips or bounds. Thus ricochet in practice means to bounce away fast, with little loss of speed, whereas deflect stresses the change in direction of a moving object. Compare these two examples. [The bullet ricocheted off the pavement and shattered the window glass; The arrow, deflected by strong winds, missed its target completely.] In some contexts ricochet and cannon are interchangeable, but cannon emphasizes collision and the force of the rebound whereas ricochet emphasizes the speed of the deflection. Bounce can substituted in most contexts for cannon and ricochet, but not for deflect; deflect differs essentially from the other words in not involving the actions of bounding away or collision. It means what the others only imply: a change in the direction of movement of an object.

偏转的意思是转向一边或导致某物偏离其路线。 弹跳的意思是像扔到水面上的石头一样从表面上看，产生一系列的跳跃或跳跃，因此弹跳实际上意味着弹开。速度快，速度损失很小，而偏转则强调移动物体方向的变化[子弹从人行道上弹开，打碎了窗户玻璃；箭头被强风偏转，完全偏离了目标。 .] 在某些情况下，弹跳和大炮可以互换，但大炮强调碰撞和反弹力，而弹跳则强调偏转速度，在大多数情况下可以替代大炮和弹跳，但与偏转没有本质上的不同；换句话说，不涉及弹跳或碰撞的动作，这意味着其他词仅暗示：物体运动方向的改变。


4.105 Boundary
These words denote a line that marks the outermost part of an area, or a division between areas. Boundary is used chiefly of territory, and suggests a definite demarcation, such as a line or mark that can be precisely located on a map. Bounds are less definite, and may be used figuratively of behaviour: His impudence exceeds all bounds. In military usage out of bounds serves to notify military personnel not to enter the building or area so stigmatized. This use is extended to any area forbidden to certain persons: The girl’s recreation area in the school is out of bounds to boys. The colloquial expression out of bounds, derived from its use in various sports, is commonly used with the meaning of unfair, improper or indecent: Holding hands was out of bounds, and as for kissing ?that was unthinkable.

这些词表示标记区域最外部的线，或区域之间的分界线，主要用于领土，并表示明确的分界线，例如可以在地图上精确定位的线或标记。不太明确，可以比喻性地使用：他的无礼超出了所有界限。在军事用途中，out ofbounds 是为了通知军事人员不要进入受到污名化的建筑物或区域。这种用法扩展到任何禁止某些人进入的区域：学校里的女生休闲区对男生来说是禁区 这个口语表达“out ofbound”源自其在各种体育运动中的使用，通常具有不公平、不正当或不雅的含义：牵手是禁区，并且至于接吻？那是不可想象的。

Whereas boundary points to an outermost limit, border emphasizes the division between two areas: the border between the U.S.S.R. and Finland. [He crossed the border into Belgium; By international agreement the boundary of each nation fronting a body of water extends exactly three miles from the coastline.] Border often suggests a territorial feature, such as a river or mountain range, and hence is not as precise as boundary. Boundaries may be changed by treaties, i.e. on paper; borders may change by the changing course of a river or by military action.

除了边界指向最外面的界限外，边界强调两个区域之间的划分：苏联和芬兰之间的边界[他越过边界进入比利时；根据国际协议，每个国家面向水域的边界正好延伸三英里。 ] 边界通常表示领土特征，例如河流或山脉，因此边界不像条约那样精确，即在纸面上，边界可能会因河流或山脉的走向而改变。通过军事行动。

Limit is the most general term of this group, and can be applied to any outermost extent, range, demarcation, etc. as here considered the term is usually plural: to pass beyond the city limits. Frontier may refer to the part of a nation’s territory lying along the border of another country; it thus describes the border region of a country from an interior perspective. Frontier also means the part of a settled region lying along the border of an unsettled region; the frontier towns of the American Wild West. Frontier is often used in extended senses; beyond the frontier of knowledge; at the frontier of space exploration.

限制是该组中最通用的术语，可以应用于任何最外层的范围、范围、分界等，因为这里认为该术语通常是复数的：超越城市边界可以指一个国家的一部分。位于另一个国家边境的领土；因此，它从内部角度描述了一个国家的边境地区，也意味着位于美国狂野西部边境城镇的定居地区的一部分。前沿通常用于扩展意义；超越知识的前沿；空间探索的前沿。

Confines, like bounds, defines the extent of an area without reference to what lies beyond, but confines is less consistently restricted to the description of geographical limits: He was not permitted to pass beyond the confines of his room. Confines, like bounds, is commonly used figuratively: His genius soared beyond the narrow confines of his education; beyond all bounds of decency or common sense.

界限，就像界限一样，定义了一个区域的范围，而不涉及超出的范围，但界限不太一致地局限于地理限制的描述：他不被允许超出他房间的界限。 界限，就像界限一样，是不允许的。通常用来比喻：他的天才超越了他所受教育的狭隘范围；超越了一切正派或常识的界限。

4.106 Brand
These words can all be used to describe commercial names, commodities, and services, and are in this sense related; but they are not synonyms, and there are important distinctions of fact to be made between them. Brand is generally understood to mean a definite, usually well-known and advertised type of commodity: the Lipton brand of tea; a popular brand of cigarettes. By extension, brand name identifies a whole group of products made or sold by the same enterprise: Westinghouse is the brand name of a line of electrical appliances.

这些词都可以用来描述商业名称、商品和服务，并且在这个意义上是相关的；但它们不是同义词，并且它们之间存在重要的区别。 ，通常是知名且广告宣传的商品类型：立顿品牌的茶；推而广之，品牌名称标识同一企业生产或销售的整个产品组：西屋电气是一个系列的品牌名称。的电器。

Trademark (sometimes hyphenated as a trade-mark) comes closet to having a definite legal status, especially when formally registered with the appropriate government agency. Legally, a trademark is a word, symbol, device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured and sold by others. Of the thousands in active use, most take the form of words, as Kodak, Vaseline, Technicolor, Coca-Cola, Dacron, etc. it will be noted that such words are spelt with an initial capital letter, a practice strongly recommended by their owners as a means of emphasizing exclusive rights to the good will and equity inherent in their commercial use.
	
商标（有时用连字符作为商标）几乎具有明确的法律地位，特别是在适当的政府机构正式注册后。 从法律上讲，商标是制造商采用和使用的文字、符号、图案或其任意组合。或商人识别他的商品并将其与其他人制造和销售的商品区分开来，大多数采用文字形式，如柯达、凡士林、特艺、可口可乐、涤纶等。这些单词的首字母大写，这是其所有者强烈推荐的做法，作为强调商业使用中固有的善意和公平的专有权利的一种手段。

Trade name, though used as a variant of trademark, is legally synonymous with the commercial name under which a firm, enterprise, corporation, association, etc. conducts its business. [3M Company is the trade name of a manufacturer of industrial products, many of which carry trademarks.]

商号虽然用作商标的变体，但在法律上是公司、企业、公司、协会等开展业务的商业名称的同义词[3M 公司是工业产品制造商的商号。其中带有商标。]

A logotype is any single piece of type containing several letters, a word or words. In advertising, logotype applies specifically to a particular design or style used to represent the name of a company or a trade mark so as to make it more readily identifiable and emphasizes its protected status in the public mind. Thus there are logotypes ?or logos, as they are called for short ?for may well-known trademarks.

标识是包含多个字母、一个或多个单词的任何单个字体，在广告中，标识专门适用于代表公司名称或商标的特定设计或风格，以便更容易识别和使用。强调其在公众心目中的受保护地位，因此出现了标识（或徽标），因为它们是驰名商标的缩写。

A colophon was formerly an inscription placed at the end of a books, showing the title, the printer’s name, date and other information, such as the style and size of type used. Now the word is more commonly used to refer to a design or emblem adopted by a publisher to represent a particular line of books or the publishing house as a whole; the colophon is usually printed on the title page of books.

版权页以前是放置在书籍末尾的铭文，显示标题、印刷商名称、日期和其他信息，例如所用字体的样式和大小。现在，该词更常用于指设计或设计。出版商采用的标志，代表特定系列的书籍或整个出版社；版权页通常印在书籍的扉页上。


4.107 Brandish
These words are synonyms when they mean to move something rapidly back and forth or in circles. Brandish means to wave or shake a weapon, especially in public, so as to threaten or intimidate someone: The drunk at the bar suddenly brandished a gun, and everybody scrambled for cover. Flourish implies a display of self-confidence, triumph or merely high-spirits: The victorious army flourished a captured flag.

这些词是同义词，意思是快速地来回移动某物或绕圈移动。 Brandish 的意思是挥舞或摇动武器，尤其是在公共场合，以威胁或恐吓某人：酒吧里的醉汉突然挥舞着枪，然后。每个人都争先恐后地寻找掩护，这意味着自信、胜利或仅仅是兴高采烈的表现：胜利的军队挥舞着缴获的旗帜。

Swing, in this sense, means to move rhythmically to and fro or backwards and forwards, like the pendulum of a clock or the clapper of a bell. It may imply a wide, sweeping motion, even rotation: to swing an axe; Huckleberry Finn recommended swinging a dead cat over one’s head to cure warts. Wield emphasizes the command one has over the sue of a weapon or instrument: to wield a hammer and chisel; to wield forceps with consummate skill. Sometimes wield approaches brandish in meaning: He turned to towards me and suddenly wielded a short, ugly knife.

从这个意义上说，“摇摆”意味着有节奏地前后或前后移动，就像钟摆或钟声一样。它可能意味着广泛的、扫过的动作，甚至旋转：挥舞斧头；建议用一只死猫在头上挥舞来治疗疣，强调一个人对武器或工具的指挥：挥舞锤子和凿子；有时挥舞的意思是挥舞。突然向我挥舞着一把又短又丑的刀。

4.108 Brashness
These words describe shameless, bold or arrogantly brusque behaviour. Brashness indicates a decisive, insistently aggressive or come-what-may attitude. When the word is approving, it expresses wonder or admiration for someone’s audacity and zest; more commonly, it is used to criticize a rash lack of judgement or a lack of consideration for others: the brashness of such a small country in successfully defending itself against its enemies; a foolhardy brashness that often tempted him to tackle situations he knew nothing about; the brashness with which he pushed his way to the top of the heap, injuring the feelings of everyone else in the office. The word can also point to a garish vulgarity of taste: The brashness of his sports clothes almost made my eyeballs ache. Sauciness suggests, instead, an imperious, insouciant and haughty manner, often exhibited in an inferior or in someone replying sharply or out of turn: the sauciness of that impertinent little salesgirl; the indignant sauciness with which he refused to take his nap. Often, the word can be used humorously or affectionately to describe the spirited display of someone who is weak or powerless: the roguish sauciness of a small kitten: the boy’s sauciness in grandly declining to play house with his older sister.
	
这些词描述了无耻、大胆或傲慢的行为，表示一种果断、坚持侵略或不择手段的态度。批评鲁莽地缺乏判断力或缺乏对他人的考虑：这样一个小国在抵御敌人时的鲁莽鲁莽常常诱使他去处理他一无所知的情况；他一路走上巅峰，伤害了办公室里其他人的感情，这个词也可以暗示一种花哨粗俗的品味：他的运动服的傲慢几乎让我的眼球感到疼痛，相反，它暗示着一种专横。 ，漫不经心和傲慢的态度，经常表现出低人一等或尖锐或不合时宜的回答：那个无礼的小女售货员的无礼；他拒绝午睡时的愤怒无礼通常，这个词可以用幽默或幽默的方式使用。亲切地形容弱者或无能为力的人的活泼表现：小猫的顽皮俏皮；男孩堂而皇之地拒绝和姐姐一起玩过家家的俏皮。

The remaining words are all extremely informal words for the idea of brazen insolence and self-seeking. Of these, however, only nerve can function with either positive or negative force. When approving, the word points to cool self-possession and courage in acting against odds: It took nerve for him to stand up for his rights in an atmosphere thick with recrimination and threats of reprisal. In disapproval, nerve suggests a shameless disregard for good taste or manners: Imagine the nerve of him, asking her to stay with him for the night! Brass, hide and cheek indicate an insistent and insolent self-assurance. Brass is the most disapproving of the three, suggesting a coarse or ingrained lack of sensitivity to the feelings of others: He had the brass to tell me I had no right to correct him. Hide is less strong but still has a connotation of deliberately insensitive behaviour: the hide of him, arriving 40 minutes late. Cheek is milder in suggesting a smug self-regard that prompts uncritical, brazen or tasteless behaviour: the cheek to ask for a rise after a week in his new job. Like sauciness, the word can be used humorously or affectionately for a cute forwardness in one’s inferiors: the cheek of the boy in asking for another helping of dessert. Gall is the most severely disapproving of all these words, suggesting shameless acts of unwarranted discourtesy: the gall to invite himself to tea. But the word is very general, applying to any act one dislikes.

其余的词都是非常非正式的词，表示厚颜无耻和自私自利，但是，只有神经才能在赞同时发挥积极或消极的力量。在反对的情况下采取行动：他需要勇气在充满相互指责和报复威胁的气氛中维护自己的权利，在不赞成的情况下，勇气意味着对良好品味或礼仪的无耻漠视：想象一下他要求她这样做的勇气。和他一起过夜！黄铜，隐藏和脸颊表明了一种坚持和傲慢的自信。黄铜是三者中最不赞成的，表明对他人的感受粗鲁或根深蒂固的缺乏敏感性：他有黄铜要告诉。对我来说，我没有权利纠正他。隐藏的行为不那么强烈，但仍然有严重麻木不仁的含义：他迟到了 40 分钟，它更温和地暗示了一种自以为是的自尊，导致不批判、厚颜无耻或无品位。行为：新工作一周后厚颜无耻地要求加薪，就像“傲慢”一样，这个词可以幽默地或亲切地用来形容下属的可爱的率性：男孩厚颜无耻地要求再吃一份甜点。对所有这些词最严厉的反对是，暗示无礼无礼的无耻行为：无礼地请自己喝茶，但这个词非常笼统，适用于任何人不喜欢的行为。

4.109 Brave
These words indicate a readiness to face danger, difficulty or even death when called upon by circumstances to do so. Brave is the most general word. It indicates the showing of one’s mettle under stress, implying self-possession and resolution. Courageous, like brave, may focus on response to a situation, but it often implies firmness arising from strong moral convictions. Both words imply a willingness to proceed with the necessary in spite of external deterrents or internal misgivings. A brave or courageous soldier carries out a dangerous mission, not without fear, but without letting fear prevent him from doing his duty.
	
这些词表示在情况需要时愿意面对危险、困难甚至死亡。勇敢是最普遍的词，它表示一个人在压力下表现出的勇气，就像勇敢一样。 ，可能侧重于对情况的反应，但它通常意味着坚定的道德信念，这两个词都意味着尽管有外部威慑或内部疑虑，仍愿意采取必要的行动，勇敢或勇敢的士兵执行危险的任务。并非没有恐惧，但不要让恐惧阻止他履行职责。

Dauntless and undaunted indicate bravery under exceptionally trying circumstances. Both imply a refusal to be disheartened, intimidated or otherwise discouraged from going on. [Scientists pursue their experiments with dauntless determination, despite repeated failures and disappointments; Stalemated negotiators must resume their talks each day with undaunted optimism.] Fearless and intrepid imply a resolute freedom from fear or a cool, unshakable determination. [A fearless, crusading newspaper exposes corruption in high places without being deterred by the danger of reprisal; The intrepid explorers hacked their way through the jungle in spite of the constant danger of native attack.]

无畏和无畏都表示在异常艰难的情况下的勇敢。 两者都意味着拒绝灰心丧气、恐吓或因其他原因而灰心丧气地继续下去。无所畏惧的乐观主义意味着坚决摆脱恐惧或冷静、不可动摇的决心[一份无所畏惧的十字军报纸揭露了高层的腐败行为，而没有被报复的危险所吓倒；勇敢的探险家在丛林中开辟了一条道路。尽管存在持续的本地攻击危险。]

Valiant and valorous are applied to persons and actions that exhibit the kind of courage and fortitude associated with knighthood. Valiant may suggest bravery shown in a worthy cause, against impossible odds, or with commendable consequences. Valorous is usually applied to the spirit or deeds of the valiant. A valiant fireman may save persons trapped in a burning building by a valorous disregard of his own safety.

Valiant 和 valorous 指表现出与骑士精神相关的勇气和毅力的人和行为，Valiant 可能表示在一项有价值的事业中表现出的勇敢，克服不可能的困难，或取得值得赞扬的后果。勇敢的消防员可以不顾自身安危，勇敢地拯救被困在燃烧建筑物中的人们。

Heroic and gallant outstanding bravery coupled with nobility of motive or selfless dedication. Heroic stresses exceptional courage, fortitude or enterprise, especially in time of war or danger. It implies a willingness to risk or sacrifice one’s life to save another or others. Gallant implies inner nobility that is manifested in chivalrous action. [The storming of Gallipoli was a heroic action of gallant men.]

英雄和英勇 杰出的勇敢加上高尚的动机或无私的奉献精神，英雄强调非凡的勇气、毅力或进取心，特别是在战争或危险时期，它意味着愿意冒着生命危险或牺牲自己的生命来拯救他人或他人。 [攻克加里波利是勇敢者的英雄行为。]

Plucky is a somewhat informal word, usually applied to contenders who persist against unfavourable odds. A plucky prize-fighter does his best to hold his own against a heavier, more skilful opponent. Bold indicates an actively brave nature or a confident audacity. The bold man is daring and is undeterred by fear of consequences: the R.A.F.’s bold bombing of the Ruhr dams in 1943 spread destruction across Germany’s industrial heartland.

勇敢是一个非正式的词，通常用于指在不利的情况下坚持不懈的竞争者，勇敢的职业拳击手尽最大努力对抗更重、更有技巧的对手。人类是勇敢的，不会因担心后果而被吓倒：1943 年英国皇家空军对鲁尔大坝的大胆轰炸给德国工业中心地带带来了破坏。

4.110 Break
These words refer to the forcible destruction, breaching or injury of something. Break is the most general word. It most often suggests the separation of a rigid body into pieces, implying either partial or total destruction of a whole: breaking the firewood in two for easier burning; breaking a vase by accident. Break may also indicate a temporary injury, as to a bone: breaking a leg in a fall. And it may involve getting free from some restraint or enclosure: to break out of goal; buds breaking open. Burst is close to break in this latter sense but involves much greater violence. It is highly specific word, suggesting a forceful breaking open that is due to internal pressure: squeezing a pimple until it bursts open; a dam so weakened by floods that it finally burst; blowing up a balloon until it bursts.

这些词指的是对某物的强行破坏、破坏或伤害，它最常表示将刚性体分成碎片，暗示整体的部分或全部破坏：将木柴劈成两半。更容易燃烧；意外打破花瓶也可能表示暂时受伤：跌倒时摔断腿；并且可能涉及摆脱某些限制或围栏：花蕾破开；破裂在后一种意义上接近破裂，但涉及更大的暴力，这是一个非常具体的词，表明由于内部压力而产生的强力破裂：挤压一个疙瘩，直到它破裂；一座被洪水削弱的水坝，最终破裂。爆裂；吹气球直到爆裂。

Crack usually means to break without separation of parts. It suggests the breaking out across a surface of slit-like openings or hairline ruptures, either because of wear, age or pressure: a window that he cracked by leaning against it; a cracked cup; linoleum that had faded and cracked. In other uses, crack may mean to break apart or break into pieces: Cracking open the walnut without breaking the kernel. Fracture can suggest a deeper, more thorough, but also more localized breaking than crack: fracturing the bone in two places; boulders fractured by continual freezing and thawing; old habit patterns fractured by changing technology.

裂纹通常意味着由于磨损、老化或压力而在表面上出现裂缝状开口或发丝状破裂：靠在破裂的杯子上而破裂的窗户；在其他用途​​中，裂纹可能意味着裂开或碎成碎片：在不破坏核桃仁的情况下，裂纹可以表示比裂纹更深、更彻底、但也更局部的破裂：使核桃破裂。骨头在两处；巨石因不断的冻结和融化而断裂；旧的习惯模式因技术的变化而断裂。

Shatter and shiver most often suggest a total breaking up of a thin surface. Shatter is the more general of the two, implying the breaking of such a surface into sharp pieces or jagged fragments: heavy enough to shatter the melting ice; a well-aimed stone that shattered the already cracked window. The word can, however, refer to the breaking of any brittle object, in which case, it suggests reduction to many fairly small pieces: a marble statue that had been completely shattered in the earthquake. Shiver, by contrast, is more closely restricted to glass or glass-like surfaces, suggesting a reduction into long, narrow shards or slivers: shivering the mirror. The word might now seem outdated except as a noun.

破碎和颤抖通常表示薄表面的完全破裂。破碎是两者中较为普遍的一种，意味着将这样的表面破碎成锋利的碎片或锯齿状的碎片：重量足以粉碎融化的冰；然而，这个词可以指任何易碎物体的破碎，在这种情况下，它意味着破碎成许多相当小的碎片：在地震中完全破碎的大理石雕像，相比之下，“颤抖的镜子”更严格地局限于玻璃或类似玻璃的表面，表明它被简化为又长又窄的碎片或条子：“颤抖的镜子”除了作为名词之外，现在似乎已经过时了。

Crush and smash suggest forceful action taken to destroy or break something. Crush points to the effect of great external pressure: it suggests squeezing something out of shape: crushing the empty cigarette packed in one hand; eggs that had been crushed by tinned goods placed on top of them in the carton. Smash describes the kind of complete deformation resulting from a heavy, noisy blow. This word suggests the shattering of something brittle either by throwing it or by throwing something against it: smashing the window with his bare fist: He smashed the bottle to smithereens against the rocks.

“crush”和“smash”表示为破坏或破坏某物而采取的强力行动“Crush”指的是外部巨大压力的作用：它表示将某物挤压变形：用一只手压碎装在罐头物品上的空香烟； “粉碎”描述了因重击而产生的完全变形，这个词暗示着通过扔东西或用东西撞碎易碎的东西：用拳头砸碎窗户：他。把瓶子撞在岩石上，摔成了碎片。

4.111 Bright
All these words refer most specifically to the intense, steady light emitted from a source, rather than to wavering or reflected light. Bright is the most general of these, stressing chiefly the intensity of the light: the bright stars. It is more useful than the other words as a comparative: the brighter of the two neon signs. In its very generality, bright permits reference to wavering or reflected light, but only to emphasize intensity: a bright, cheerful fire; sun-bright ripples. Brilliant lends itself to the same uses as bright, but suggests even greater intensity: brilliant head-lights. Brilliant can have a lyrical quality absent in the more matter-of-fact bright, and consequently it can imply excellence or beauty: the brilliant, cloudless day.

所有这些词最具体地指的是从光源发出的强烈、稳定的光，而不是波动或反射的光。“明亮”是其中最笼统的，主要强调光的强度：“明亮的星星”比“明亮的星星”更有用。另一个词作为比较：两个霓虹灯标志中较亮的一个，一般来说，“明亮”可以指波动或反射的光，但只是为了强调强度：明亮、欢快的火焰适合于阳光般明亮的涟漪。与“明亮”的用法相同，但暗示更大的强度：“辉煌”可以具有更实际的“明亮”所没有的抒情品质，因此它可以暗示卓越或美丽：灿烂、万里无云的日子。

Incandescent suggests light created specifically by combustion, and it may or may not carry overtones of emitted warmth as well as light. Incandescent may simply refer technically to a white-hot light: an incandescent lamp. In other uses it suggests fierceness or intense whiteness rather than the excellence or beauty of brilliant: the incandescent glare of the street lights.

白炽灯表示专门由燃烧产生的光，它可能会或可能不会带有发出的温暖和光的色彩，从技术上讲，白炽灯可能只是指白炽灯：在其他用途​​中，它表示强烈或强烈的白色。比辉煌的卓越或美丽更重要：路灯的白炽眩光。

Resplendent is in every way an intensification of brilliant; though more formal, it is even more lyrical, stressing vivid brightness and dazzling splendour: the resplendent sun; a sky resplendent with stars. Resplendent can refer to sources of reflected light as well, but with the same lyrical force and implication of lustre, bedecked with diamonds and resplendent in her jewelled gown.

从各方面来说，灿烂都是辉煌的强化；虽然更正式，但更抒情，强调生动的亮度和令人眼花缭乱的辉煌：辉煌的太阳；灿烂的星星也可以指反射光的来源。同样的抒情力量和光泽的含义，镶满了钻石，在她的珠宝礼服上熠熠生辉。

Effulgent is like resplendent in lyricism and formality except that it is more precisely restricted to sources of light. Also, its extreme formality may make its use seem inflated or pretentious: effulgent rays streaming through the thunderhead.

Effulgent在抒情性和形式上就像辉煌一样，只不过它更精确地局限于光源。此外，它的极端形式可能使它的使用看起来夸大或自命不凡：明亮的光线流过雷雨云。

While far less formal than resplendent or effulgent, shining as an adjective has been so overworked when used with lyrical intent that it may now strike one as a cliché in most contexts: a knight in shining armour. Shining may escape this liability when it is merely descriptive: the shining beacon far out at sea. Used in such a way, it contrasts with all the foregoing words by describing light that need not necessarily be intense. Glowing and radiant, similarly, do not emphasize intensity. Glowing suggests a slow burning or the last stage of burning; it implies warmth as well, but faintness of both light and warmth may be the point of its use: the glowing remains of a fire. Radiant suggests the emission of light in all directions; it carries a unique connotation of mild, gentle warmth: a radiant spring day, so unlike those of incandescent summer. Beaming refers specifically to light sent out in long arms, either stationary or sweeping: the beaming searchlight.

虽然“闪亮”远没有“辉煌”或“辉煌”那么正式，但当用于抒情意图时，“闪亮”这个形容词已经被过度使用，以至于在大多数情况下它可能会让人觉得是陈词滥调：穿着闪亮盔甲的骑士可能会逃脱这种责任，而它仅仅是这样。描述性：远方的闪亮灯塔以这种方式使用，与前面所有的词形成鲜明对比，它描述不一定是强烈的光，同样，发光并不强调强度。燃烧的最后阶段；它也暗示着温暖，但光的微弱和温暖可能是它的用途：发光的余烬暗示着向四面八方发射光；温和、温柔的温暖：与白炽夏日不同的是，光芒四射的春日特指长臂发出的光，无论是静止的还是扫射的：光束探照灯。

All these words can refer figuratively to qualities of personality, intelligence or passion. Indeed, their metaphorical use has been extensive in describing all that is good or desirable in human nature ?perhaps a comment on the high value man has continued to place on light. In brief, bright refers to intelligence, but more as potential than as accomplishment: a bright student. Brilliant goes beyond bright to indicate great intellect or talent. It may also refer to a highly admired accomplishment or illustrious achievement: a brilliant novel. Resplendent may suggest the blaze and brilliance of triumph or majesty: soldiers resplendent in victory. Effulgent may describe something that seems to radiate outwards like light: her effulgent loveliness. Glowing suggests their satisfaction ?or a being possessed by calmer, gentler feelings: eyes glowing with desire; a face radiant with tenderness. Beaming suggests pleasure or self-satisfaction, while shining in most of its figurative uses is decidedly trite.

所有这些词都可以象征性地指代人格、智慧或激情的品质。事实上，它们的隐喻用途广泛地描述了人性中所有美好或令人向往的事物——也许对人类高价值的评论仍然存在于光之上。简而言之，“聪明”指的是智力，但更多的是指潜力而不是成就：“聪明的学生”不仅指聪明才智或才华横溢，还可以指令人高度赞赏的成就或杰出的成就：辉煌的小说。表示胜利或威严的火焰和光辉：胜利中辉煌的士兵可能会描述一些似乎像光一样向外辐射的东西：她的光辉灿烂表示他们的满足——或者是一种被更平静、更温和的情感所占据的感觉：眼睛里闪烁着渴望。 ; 容光焕发的面孔暗示着快乐或自我满足，而闪耀在其大多数比喻用法中显然是陈词滥调。

4.112 Brusque
All these words point to a shortness or discourtesy of manner in a person’s treatment of others. Brusque derives from an Italian word meaning rude. It is applied to a noticeably short, brisk or terse manner that may or may not be rude, depending on intent and circumstance. [A no-nonsense woman, the governess gave her employer a brusque handshake; Being in a hurry, he made an unintentionally brusque reply.] At worst, brusque may imply incivility, ungracious sharpness or undue severity: a brusque dismissal. Bluff, by contrast, is not at all negative in tone but implies a hearty frankness ?an openness that may lack finesse but does not intend discourtesy. Bluff is used almost exclusively to describe men. The bluff man talks and laughs loudly and freely, says and does whatever he pleases with fearless good nature, and with no thought of annoying or giving pain to others: A bluff, beefy man, he didn’t mince his words, but there was a twinkle in his eye. Blunt is fairly close to bluff at one extreme, though it can imply only a well-meaning directness. Unlike bluff, however, blunt more often suggests a flat-footed forthrightness that verges on discourtesy. It may describe a manner of speech as well as a person. [Shall I lie politely to you, or shall I be blunt? Be as blunt as you like ?I won’t mind your rudeness if you tell me the truth.] At the other extreme, blunt may indicate a tactless frankness that is inconsiderate or needlessly cruel. The blunt man may say things which he is perfectly aware are disagreeable, either from a defiant indifference to others?feelings or from the pleasure of tormenting. Short has a connotation of quickness and directness, with a hint of anger and perhaps rudeness: I was very short with him for asking such a foolish question.

所有这些词都表示一个人对待他人的粗鲁或无礼行为，Brusque 源自意大利语，意思是粗鲁，它适用于明显简短、轻快或简洁的方式，可能是粗鲁的，也可能不是粗鲁的。 [一个严肃的女人，家庭女教师粗鲁地与她的雇主握手；由于匆忙，他无意中粗鲁地回答了。] 在最坏的情况下，粗鲁可能意味着不礼貌、不礼貌的尖锐或过度严厉：粗鲁的解雇。相比之下，“虚张声势”的语气一点也不消极，而是暗示一种真诚的坦诚——一种可能缺乏技巧但无意无礼的开放性。“虚张声势”几乎专门用来形容男人大声而自由地说话和笑。他怀着无所畏惧的善良本性做任何他想做的事，没有想到会惹恼或给别人带来痛苦：他是一个直言不讳、强健的人，说话毫不拐弯抹角，但他的眼睛里闪烁着相当接近的光芒。虚张声势在一个极端，虽然它只能意味着善意的直接，然而，与虚张声势不同，直率更经常意味着一种近乎无礼的直率。我有礼貌地对你撒谎，还是应该直言不讳？如果你告诉我真相，我不会介意你的粗鲁。] 在另一个极端，直言不讳可能表示不体贴或不必要的坦率。直率的人可能会说一些他完全意识到的令人不快的话，要么是出于对他人感情的挑衅冷漠，要么是出于折磨的乐趣。我对他提出这样一个愚蠢的问题感到很生气。

Abrupt and curt both suggest an uncooperative terseness, especially in reply to a question or appeal for help. His laconic answers to my repeated requests for directions were both unfriendly and abrupt.

唐突和生硬都表明了一种不合作的简洁，尤其是在回答问题或寻求帮助时，他对我反复询问的简洁回答既不友好又唐突。

Abrupt may also imply a disconcerting directness: an abrupt refusal. Curt is stronger than abrupt, implying hardness or coldness of manner as well as a willful intent to be unpleasant: a curt rejoinder. [I can understand being a little abrupt if one is really busy, but she’s always curt even when she’s just wasting her time.]

突然的拒绝也可能意味着令人不安的直接：突然的拒绝比突然的拒绝更强烈，暗示着态度的强硬或冷漠以及故意令人不愉快：简短的反驳[如果一个人真的很突然，我可以理解。很忙，但即使她只是在浪费时间，她也总是很简短。]

Gruff and surly suggest bad-tempered or rude behaviour; but they need not imply either straightforwardness, as in bluff and blunt, or undue brevity of response, as in abrupt and curt. Of the two words, gruff is more appropriately applied to a man and is most applicable to disposition. It describes one who is brusque, rough and crusty in manner or hoarse and guttural in speech. [He’ll grumble for minutes at a time when he’s gruff and grouchy, but don’t expect a straight answer from him then.] Surly suggests extreme discourtesy and may be applied to either sex. It implies not so much a sour frame of mind as an abiding attitude of hostility to people ?a crabbed, churlish disposition evident in both speech and manner: a surly, insubordinate servant. [Give me the gruffest salesman in the world and I won’t complain ?just so long as I don’t have to put up with that surly woman in the lingerie department. I’ll even take the blunt remarks about my figure from the woman in the dress department or the curt answers of the credit manager when I ask to pay by cheque. Believe me, a surly salesgirl is far worse.]

gruff 和 surly 表示脾气暴躁或粗鲁的行为；但它们不一定意味着直率（如虚张声势和直率），也不一定意味着反应过于简短（如唐突和生硬），在这两个词中，gruff 更适合用于男人。它最适用于性格粗暴、粗鲁、脾气暴躁或说话声音嘶哑、喉咙发哑的人[当他粗暴、脾气暴躁时，他会抱怨几分钟，但不要指望得到直接的回答。 ] 粗暴的意思是极端的无礼，可以适用于任何性别。与其说它意味着一种阴郁的心态，不如说是一种对人持久的敌意态度——一种在言语和举止上都明显表现出来的乖戾、粗暴的性格：一种粗暴的态度。 ，不听话的仆人。 [给我一个世界上最粗鲁的推销员，我不会抱怨？只要我不必忍受内衣部门那个脾气暴躁的女人，我什至会接受关于她的直言不讳的言论。服装部那位女士的身材或者当我要求用支票付款时信贷经理的简短回答相信我，一个脾气暴躁的女售货员的情况要糟糕得多。]

4.113 Bug
These words relate to a large and varied division of invertebrate animals. Bug and wog are names loosely applied to any very small creeping, crawling, jumping or flying creature that is generally thought of as a nuisance. Wog is the more informal and is even applied to the completely unrelated bacteria and viruses that cause disease, especially a cold which is "going around": Sorry I can’t go ?I’ve got the wog. Bug is the least specific word in the group, but arthropod is the inclusive, zoological term. Arthropods have no backbone; they are characterized by jointed legs or appendages, segmented body parts and usually, hard outer coverings. The true bugs belong to a special order of arthropods whose members have biting or sucking mouth parts, such as bedbugs, water bugs and plant bugs. Beetles also have biting mouth parts and have hard, horny fore wings that cover and protect their hind wings. Bugs and beetles form part of the largest class of arthropods, the insects. There are close to a million kinds of insects, all having bodies divided into three sections, each of which carries a pair of legs, making six legs in all. This characteristic distinguishes insects from spiders, which have eight legs and which, with scorpions, mites and ticks, are placed in another separate class of arthropods, the arachnids. The class of crustaceans includes shrimps, crabs, lobsters, barnacles and crayfish, living mostly in or near water. Crustaceans are characterized by tough outer shells that are shed by moulting as they grow larger.

这些词与大量不同的无脊椎动物有关，Bug 和 Wog 广泛用于任何非常小的爬行、爬行、跳跃或飞行生物，通常被认为是一种讨厌的动物，甚至被广泛使用。对于引起疾病的完全不相关的细菌和病毒，尤其是“四处传播”的感冒：抱歉我不能去？我知道“虫子”是该组中最不具体的词，但节肢动物是包容性的。节肢动物没有脊椎；它们的特征是有关节的腿或附肢、分段的身体部位和通常坚硬的外壳。真正的昆虫属于节肢动物的特殊目，其成员有咬或吸的口器，例如臭虫。 、水蝽和植物蝽也有咬性口器，并具有覆盖和保护后翅的坚硬角质前翅。昆虫和甲虫是节肢动物中最大的一类，有近百万种。昆虫的身体分为三部分，每部分都有一对腿，总共有六条腿，这一特征将昆虫与蜘蛛区分开来，蜘蛛有八条腿，并与蝎子、螨虫和蜱虫一起生活。节肢动物的另一类是蜘蛛纲动物，包括虾、螃蟹、龙虾、藤壶和小龙虾，它们主要生活在水中或水附近，其外壳坚硬，随着体型的增大而脱落。

4.114 Build
These verbs all indicate the assembling and fitting together of materials into a structure. Build, the most general and least formal word, has the widest range of uses, from the most concrete and specific to the highly figurative and abstract. [Carpenters build houses and birds build nests; Cavemen built fires at the mouths of their caves; The company director hoped to build a business empire; Nations built their hopes for peace on the fear of nuclear war.] Construct has a much more limited range of application. It emphasizes the intricate or complex nature of a building process, where build may focus on the assembling of separate parts and the resulting connection: to build a bookcase; to construct an office building. The phrase to build a bridge emphasizes engineering problems and the workmen and equipment involved. The same distinctions hold with reference to mental activities ?build pointing to gradual, step-by-step creation through continued efforts. [Philosophers construct complicated systems for describing existence; Neurotics may be unable to build healthy relationships.] If substituted for build in the last example, construct would have an unfortunate overtone of artificiality.

这些动词都表示将材料组装和组装成结构，这是最普遍和最不正式的词，具有最广泛的用途，从最具体和具体的到高度具象和抽象的鸟类建造巢穴。在他们的洞穴口生火；公司董事希望建立一个商业帝国；各国将和平的希望建立在对核战争的恐惧之上。] 结构的应用范围更加有限。建造一个建筑过程，其中建造可能集中于各个部件的组装以及由此产生的连接：建造一个书柜；建造一座办公楼；建造一座桥梁这个短语强调了工程问题以及所涉及的工人和设备。坚持指精神活动？build 指向通过持续努力逐步进行的创造[哲学家构建复杂的系统来描述存在；神经症患者可能无法建立健康的关系。]如果在最后一个例子中替换为“build”，不幸的是，这种结构会有一种人为的暗示。

Like build, erect may involve the assembling of parts. Erect, however, chiefly stress height and vertical position, meaning to put or set something up: to erect a skyscraper; to erect a monument; They finally built a road up the Acrocorinth to the tower that had been erected centuries before. Erect also has figurative uses: to erect a tariff wall; to erect a trade barrier.

与建造一样，“竖立”也可能涉及部件的组装，但是，“竖立”主要强调高度和垂直位置，意思是放置或设置某些东西：竖立一座摩天大楼；竖立一座纪念碑；建造一条通往阿克罗科林斯的道路。几个世纪前就已经竖立起来的塔也有象征性的用途：建立关税墙；建立贸易壁垒。

Fabricate has least the sense of building a structure on its intended location. In suggesting the assembly and fitting together of parts, it implies more the standardized manufacturing of smaller items in a factory: to fabricate parts for do-it-yourself furniture-making kits. Recent techniques of house-building have, of course, perfected the prefabrication of all units, which are then shipped and assembled on the spot. Unless this type of building or construction is meant, one would still not use fabricate of house or bridge building. In other uses, the word has taken on a strong negative overtone of artificiality or falsity: a friend who fabricates flimsy stories to conceal his irresponsibility.

Fabricate 的含义至少是在预定位置建造建筑物。在暗示将零件组装和装配在一起时，它更多地意味着在工厂中标准化制造较小的物品：为 DIY 家具制作套件制造零件。当然，最近的房屋建造技术已经完善了所有单元的预制，然后运送并在现场组装。除非是指这种类型的建筑或建筑，否则人们仍然不会使用房屋或桥梁建造的 fabricate。在其他用法中，这个词具有强烈的人为或虚假的负面含义：一个编造脆弱故事来掩盖其不负责任的朋友。

4.115 Burn
Burn, the general word, means to effect a change in an object through the action of heat or fire. The object may be changed only slightly, or it may be totally destroyed. [A cigarette burned the finish on the table; A fire burned the house down.] Although it usually connotes some degree of destruction, burning may accomplish a useful purpose. A householder burns fuel to heat the house. In autumn, a gardener burns leaves to dispose of them. Not only heat but also extreme cold, corrosive chemicals gases, electricity, radiation, friction and the like may cause the kind of surface change or stinging sensation associated with a burn. Hence, acid is said to burn the skin and a cutting wind may make the cheek burn. Burn can also mean to cause a feeling of heat in a part of the body: The hot spices burned his mouth and tongue.

烧伤，一般指通过热或火的作用使物体发生变化。物体可能只发生轻微变化，也可能被完全毁坏。[香烟烧毁了桌子的饰面；大火烧毁了房子。] 尽管烧伤通常表示某种程度的破坏，但它也可以达到有用的目的。户主燃烧燃料来取暖。秋天，园丁焚烧树叶来处理它们。不仅热，而且极冷、腐蚀性化学气体、电、辐射、摩擦等都可能导致与烧伤相关的表面变化或刺痛感。因此，据说酸会灼伤皮肤，刺骨的寒风会使脸颊灼伤。烧伤也可以表示使身体某个部位感到热：热香料烫伤了他的嘴和舌头。

To scald is to burn with a very hot liquid or steam. Thus, the careless cook may scald herself if she spills hot soup or boiling water.

烫伤是指被非常热的液体或蒸汽烫伤。因此，如果粗心的厨师洒出热汤或开水，她可能会烫伤自己。

Singe, scorch and char are related in that they mean to burn partially, slightly or superficially. To singe is to burn the surface or ends of something: The fire singed his eyebrows. Singeing is sometimes done deliberately, as to remove bristles or to keep hair from splitting. A cook may singe a plucked chicken to remove pinfeathers by passing the fowl through an open flame. To scorch is to burn something to the point of discolouration, usually by hot metal: She scorched the dress by setting the iron too high for the fabric. Char may imply a more advanced stage of combustion. It means to reduce a substance to carbon, either completely, as in charcoal, or partially: Pieces of charred wood remained after the campfire had burnt out; the charred remains of a burnt-down house.

烧焦、灼烧和炭化彼此相关，因为它们的意思是部分、轻微或浅表燃烧。烧焦是指烧伤某物的表面或末端：火烧焦了他的眉毛。烧焦有时是故意为之，比如为了去除鬃毛或防止毛发分叉。厨师可能会将拔了毛的鸡放在明火中烤焦，以去除鸡身上的细毛。灼烧是指将某物烧到褪色的程度，通常是用热金属：她把熨斗的温度调得太高，把衣服烧焦了。炭化可能意味着燃烧的更高级阶段。它的意思是将物质完全转化为碳，比如木炭，或者部分转化为碳：篝火烧尽后剩下的烧焦的木块；被烧毁的房屋的烧焦的残骸。

Sear, brand and cauterize all connote deliberate burning to achieve a definite purpose. All are also used of flesh. Of the three, sear is the most general word, as it can mean both brand and cauterize. Searing involves the subjecting of a surface to intense heat for a very short time. This may have the effect of hardening, sealing, drying up, destroying tissue or leaving an ineradicable imprint. [Before stewing the beef, the cook seared it over high heat to seal the juices in.] To brand is to sear with a hot iron, burning a mark into the flesh, as to signify ownership. A grazier brands his cattle so that he can identify them if they stray or are stolen. To Cauterize is to sear tissue with a caustic agent or heated iron for curative purposes. A doctor may cauterize a wound to prevent infection.

Sear、brand 和 cauterize 都表示为了达到某个目的而故意烧灼。所有这些词也用于指肉体。在这三个词中，sear 是最常用的词，因为它既可以表示 brand，又可以表示 cauterize。searing 涉及将表面置于极短时间内的高温下。这可能会使其变硬、封住、变干、破坏组织或留下无法磨灭的印记。[在炖牛肉之前，厨师会用大火将其炙烤以将汁液封在里面。]brand 是用烧红的铁烙，在肉上烙出痕迹，以表明所有权。牧场主会给他的牛打上烙印，以便在它们走失或被盗时识别它们。Cauterize 是用腐蚀剂或烧红的铁烙组织以达到治疗目的。医生可能会烧灼伤口以防止感染。

4.116 Busy
These adjectives all refer to activity or involvement. Busy is the
least formal word. It may indicate nothing more than that a person is
working on or doing something or that a thing is in use. [Mr. Brown is
busy right now; The line is busy.] Or it may imply constant,
concentrated involvement in business or intensive and varied activity
of any kind: a busy man; a busy day; a busy market place; a busy
legislative session. The effort involved in being or staying busy may be,
by implication, valuable or productive: Get busy and get something
done. But in some cases, the word gives a special overtone of empty
fuss and hollow results: busy work to keep the troops out of trouble;
kept busy half the day by peddling neighbourhood gossip.

这些形容词全都指活动或参与。忙碌是最不正式的词。它可能仅表示某人正在工作或做某事，或某物正在使用中。[布朗先生现在很忙；电话占线。] 也可能暗示持续、集中精力参与业务或任何类型的密集而多样的活动：忙碌的人；忙碌的一天；繁忙的市场；繁忙的立法会议。忙碌或保持忙碌所涉及的努力可能暗示有价值或富有成效：忙起来，把某事做完。但在一些情况下，这个词带有空洞的忙乱和空洞的结果的特殊含义：忙碌的工作让部队远离麻烦；忙着散播邻里八卦，度过半天的忙碌时光。

Active stresses action, operation or involvement as opposed to
passivity or dormancy: an active man; an active life; an active listing.
Active accounts are productive and active investments yield interest.
An active volcano is not extinct but may erupt, though it seldom does.
Used of persons, active often points to actual work or participation as
contrasted with mere approval or association: active on behalf of the
spastic centre; active in community affairs; an active club members as
opposed to a mere name on the rolls. A soldier on active duty is
involved in military service on a full-time basis, but he may not be busy
all the time. Active may also mean brisk or lively, suggesting a
heaviness of traffic or transactions: a day of active trading.

积极 强调行动、运作或参与，而不是被动或休眠：积极的人；积极的生活；积极的清单。活跃的账户是富有成效的，而积极的投资会产生利息。活火山不会熄灭，但可能会喷发，尽管它很少喷发。用于人时，积极通常指实际工作或参与，而不是单纯的赞同或交往：代表痉挛中心积极活动；积极参与社区事务；积极的俱乐部成员，而不是名册上的名字。现役士兵全职参与军事服务，但他可能并非一直很忙。活跃也可能意味着活跃或活跃，暗示交通或交易繁忙：交易活跃的一天。

Occupied shares with busy and active a simple contrast with idle.
When used of a person, it suggests his involvement with a specific task:
occupied with sweeping out the fireplace. When used of an object, it
suggests it physical use at that moment. A telephone line can be busy
but cannot be occupied. Conversely, a telephone booth can be occupied
but cannot be busy. Occupied, when used of someone’s mental state,
means absorbed in thought, either purposive or idle: occupied in
adding the figures before him; She occupies herself with trifles. In
either case, it can suggest concentration to the point of distraction: so
occupied in thought that he did not see the speeding car. Engrossed
compares closely with this special use of occupied, implying even
greater concentration, but with the added suggestion of pleasurable,
willing or fascinated involvement: engrossed in a good mystery story;
engrossed in his work.

Occupied 与 busy 和 active 一样，与 idle 有一个简单的对比。当用于人时，它表明他正在忙于一项特定的任务：忙于清扫壁炉。当用于物体时，它表明它当时的物理使用。电话线可能忙但不能忙。相反，电话亭可能有人但不能忙。Occupied 用于某人的精神状态时，意味着沉浸在有目的的或无所事事的思考中：忙于将他面前的数字相加；她忙于琐事。在这两种情况下，它都可以表明注意力集中到分心的程度：他太专注于思考以至于没有看到飞驰的汽车。Engrossed 与 occupied 的这种特殊用法非常相似，暗示更加专注，但还暗示了愉快、自愿或着迷的参与：全神贯注于一个好的神秘故事；全神贯注于他的工作。

Engaged suggests involvement, like busy, but implies concentration
on a specific task, like occupied. It also has a special sense of coming to
grips with a situation: The engaged artist struggles to state the
dilemmas facing his society. It has a military use for units involved in a
hostile encounter: The engaged patrol was cut off from its own front
line. It also refers to a man and woman in the formalized period of
courtship just before marriage: an engaged couple.

Engaged 暗示着参与，就像 busy 一样，但也暗示着专注于某项特定任务，就像 occupied 一样。它还有一种特殊的含义，即应对某种情况：engaged 艺术家努力陈述其社会面临的困境。它在军事上用于指参与敌对冲突的部队：engaged 巡逻队与自己的前线隔绝。它也指一对男女在结婚前处于正式求爱阶段：一对订婚夫妇。

4.117 Candid

These words refer to the revealing or expressing of one’s true
thoughts of feelings. Candid can refer generally to a forthright manner
or statement, but the word has been heavily influenced by its related
use to refer to impromptu or unposed photographs; a candid camera is
one suitable for taking such pictures. Consequently, the word has
acquired overtones pertaining to natural, informal and unrehearsed
statements as well: he agreed to give his candid opinion if his name
weren’t mentioned in the news story. Frank can also apply in a general
way, but it is most often used to describe statements: a frank
admission of guilt. In positive use, it can indicate an admirable
openness and sincerity, but sometimes it can apply less favourably to
someone who is unnecessarily blunt or flat-footed about things, despite
other people’s feelings: her frank disapproval of the way they had
furnished their living room.

这些词指的是一个人真实想法或感受的流露或表达。Candid 通常指直率的态度或陈述，但该词深受其相关用法的影响，即指即兴或不摆姿势的照片；偷拍相机就适合拍摄此类照片。因此，该词也具有与自然、非正式和未经排练的陈述相关的含义：如果新闻报道中没有提到他的名字，他同意发表坦率的意见。Frank 也可以泛指，但它最常用于描述陈述：坦率地承认有罪。在积极用法中，它可以表示令人钦佩的开放和真诚，但有时它可能不太适用于
不顾他人感受，对事情不必要地直言不讳或措手不及的人：她坦率地反对他们布置客厅的方式。
	
Bluff sometimes stresses this last possibility of frank, indicating a
direct manner or blunt statements that show no consciousness of or
consideration for the vulnerabilities of other people: a bluff
sergeant-major teasing the men who didn’t pass inspection. The word
more often applies to men than women, and now usually means blunt
in a good-natured way: a lovable, bluff old curmudgeon.

Bluff 有时强调坦率的最后可能性，表示一种直接的方式或直言不讳的言论，没有意识到或考虑到其他人的弱点：一个直率的军士长嘲笑那些没有通过检查的人。这个词更多地适用于男性而不是女性，现在通常意味着善良的直率：一个可爱的、直率的老顽固。

Ingenuous can refer descriptively to a lack of guile, but more often it
can also suggest a person who is simple or unaware to the point of
gullibility: She gave ingenuous answers to all the stranger’s question.
The word frequently applies more to manner or disposition than to
individual statements.

Ingenuous 可以描述为缺乏诡计，但更多时候也可以指一个人单纯或无知到容易轻信的程度：她对所有陌生人的问题都给出了坦率的回答。这个词通常更多地适用于举止或性格，而不是个人陈述。

4.118 Capture

These verbs all mean to seize and to take captive. Capture is the
strongest word. It implies the use of force or stratagem in overcoming
active resistance: to capture an enemy fort; to capture an armed
robber. Catch is the most general word. It suggests the seizure or
detection of something fugitive or elusive , often implying active pursuit,clever entrapment or a taking by surprise: to catch a runaway horse; to
catch a thief.

这些动词都表示夺取和俘虏。Capture 是最强的词。它意味着使用武力或诡计来克服主动抵抗：占领敌人堡垒；抓获武装劫匪。Catch 是最常用的词。它表示扣押或发现逃犯或神出鬼没的东西, 通常暗指主动追捕、巧妙诱捕或出其不意：抓住脱缰的马；抓捕小偷。

Arrest is applied only to persons in this sense and always carries the
implication of a legal offence. It means to take into custody by legal
authority and often involves detention in goal. Police caught him fleeing
the scene of the crime and arrested him as a suspect. Apprehend is a
more formal word for arrest, involving the seizure of someone in the
name of the law: He was apprehended five hours after his escape.
Apprehend is the sort of word used in official documents and reports; it
seems stilted or pretentious in everyday contexts. Nab and pinch are
informal synonyms for catch or arrest. Pinch is more general, while nab
stresses the suddenness of the seizure, often implying a rough
grabbing: Police nabbed him as he ran out of the raided nightclub.

逮捕 Arrest 只适用于这种意义上的人，并且总是暗示有违法行为。它意味着被法律当局拘留，通常涉及拘留。警察抓获了逃离犯罪现场的他，并将他作为嫌疑人逮捕。Apprehend是逮捕的更正式的词，涉及以法律的名义扣押某人：他逃跑五小时后被逮捕。逮捕是官方文件和报告中使用的那种词；在日常语境中，它似乎有些生硬或做作。Nab 和 pinch 是 catch 或 arrest 的非正式同义词。Pinch 更笼统，而 nab 强调扣押的突然性，通常暗示粗暴的抓捕：当他从被突袭的夜​​总会跑出来时，警察抓住了他。

In extended senses, catch and capture may mean to seize something
fleeting, to grasp something hard to get hold of. Capture implies the
greater difficulty and achievement : to catch a likeness in a sketch; an
artist who captures a fleeting expression. Both words man also mean to
captivate or enthral. [The song caught her fancy; The book captured
his imagination.]

从广义上讲，catch 和 capture 可能意味着抓住转瞬即逝的事物，抓住难以抓住的事物。Capture 意味着更大的困难和成就：在素描中捕捉相似之处；捕捉转瞬即逝的表情的艺术家。man 这两个词也意味着迷住或迷住。[这首歌引起了她的注意；这本书激发了他的想象力。]

Four of these verbs are used of the seizure of animals in hunting.
Capture is applied to wild animals brought back alive, as for exhibition
in a zoo or training by an animal tamer: to capture lions and tigers.
Catch is applied to small or harmless animals that are enticed by a bait
or fooled by camouflage: to catch fish; to catch a mouse in a trap; to
catch a bird in a snare. Trap focuses on the use of a trap, snare or
pitfall to catch unsuspecting animals; to trap fur-bearing animals for
their pelts. Persons may be trapped like animals by being caught in a
cul-de-sac, cut off from all escape routes: trapped in a burning building;
trapped in a dull job and a bad marriage. Bag is expressive of the
hunter’s satisfaction at having his quarry literally in the bag: to bag a
wild pig. In a figurative sense, bag stresses the triumph of the
successful hunt, the bringing home of some sought-after prize: She
bagged a minor poet for her salon.

其中四个动词用于表示狩猎中捕获动物。Capture 适用于活着带回来的野生动物，如在动物园展出或由驯兽师训练：捕获狮子和老虎。Catch 适用于被诱饵引诱或被伪装欺骗的小型或无害动物：捕鱼；用陷阱捉老鼠；用圈套捉鸟。Trap 侧重于使用陷阱、圈套或陷阱捕捉毫无戒心的动物；诱捕毛皮动物以获取毛皮。人可能会像动物一样被困在死胡同里，无法逃脱：被困在燃烧的建筑物中；被困在枯燥的工作和糟糕的婚姻中。Bag 表达了猎人将猎物装入袋子中的满足感：捕获一头野猪。从比喻意义上讲，“bag”强调了成功搜寻的胜利，带回了一些梦寐以求的奖品：她为她的沙龙找到了一位小诗人。

4.119 Careful

These words are all used to describe people in reference to the
care they exercise in their general behaviour, in the performance of
duties and in attention to detail. Careful is the most general word in the
list. It can mean thorough or painstaking, and in this sense suggests
the avoidance of error by virtue of the care exercised: a careful
secretary who always checked her work twice. It can mean concerned
or mindful: careful about his manners at the party. It can mean
cautious or watchful: Be careful when you drive on mountain roads.

这些词都用来形容人们在日常行为、履行职责和关注细节时所表现出的谨慎。Careful 是列表中最常用的词。它可以表示彻底或细致，在这个意义上，它表明通过小心谨慎来避免错误：一个细心的秘书总是仔细检查她的工作。它可以表示关心或留心：在聚会上注意自己的举止。它可以表示谨慎或警惕：在山路上开车时要小心。

Conscientious and scrupulous agree in connoting a painstaking
carefulness based on an ethical, logical, moral, or other standard. [A
conscientious researcher, through a highly developed regard for the
truth, is careful to avoid error or omission; A scrupulous juror, out of a
dedication to justice, is careful to weigh all the evidence and excludes
all personal feelings.]

尽职尽责和一丝不苟都意味着基于伦理、逻辑、道德或其他标准的一丝不苟。[一位尽职尽责的研究人员，通过高度尊重事实，会小心避免错误或遗漏；一位一丝不苟的陪审员，出于对正义的奉献，会小心权衡所有证据并排除所有个人感情。]

Meticulous and punctilious denote a very strict or even an excessive
attention to details or standards. Meticulous suggests an almost finicky
concern, often about trivial matters, based on a fear of making an error:
A meticulous dresser is careful to avoid all violations of the cannons of
fashion. Punctilious implies an exaggerated regard for the fine points of
the rules and forms prescribed by law or custom, as in etiquette: a
punctilious social climber who was so careful about doing everybody
else’s "right thing" that he never developed any standards of his own.

Meticulous 一丝不苟和punctilious一丝不苟都表示对细节或标准非常严格甚至过度关注。Meticulous暗示着一种近乎挑剔的关注，通常是对琐碎的事情，因为害怕犯错：meticulous的着装者会小心避免违反时尚准则。Punctilious意味着对法律或习俗规定的规则和形式的细微之处过分尊重，例如礼仪：一个Punctilious的社会攀登者，他非常小心地做别人的“正确的事情”，以至于他从未制定自己的任何标准。

    ANTONYMS: HEEDLESS, neglectful, negligent, remiss, sloppy.
	

4.120 Caress

These words refer to the pleasurable, desirous or affectionate
holding or stroking of something. Caress indicates a brief, gentle or
embracing motion expressive of love or desire: tenderly caressing her
once more before boarding the train. Fondle may stress desire more
than love, but carries the same connotation of gentleness as caress.
Whereas caress might be done with the arms and body, however,
fondle might more typically be done solely with the hands and so suggest a greater possible distance than caress: fondling the nape of
his neck with her open palm. Cuddle is more informal than the
foregoing; it specifically suggests body-to-body contact, but not
necessarily to imply desire at all so much as affectionate pleasure:
sleeping kittens cuddled next to their watchful mother. Hug
emphasizes one possibility in caress, specifically suggesting an
armclasp expressive of affection or desire. Being much more informal
than caress or fondle, and even than cuddle, hug seems better suited to
indicate earthier emotions, although it contrasts with all the foregoing
by stressing intensity of feeling rather than gentleness: desperately
hugging her injured child; turning to hug each other as soon as they
were in a secluded part of the park. Dandle is perhaps the most
specific of all these words, restricting itself most concretely to the
bouncing or rocking of a child in one’s lap or on one’s knee: gently
dandling the child as she sang a lively nursery rhyme.

这些词指的是愉悦、渴望或深情地拥抱或抚摸某物。爱抚表示一种短暂、温柔或拥抱的动作，表达爱或渴望：在登上火车前再次温柔地爱抚她。抚摸可能更强调渴望而不是爱，但与爱抚一样具有温柔的含义。然而，爱抚可以用手臂和身体来完成，而抚摸可能更通常只用手来完成，因此比爱抚暗示了更大的距离：用张开的手掌爱抚他的颈背。拥抱比前面的更不正式；它特别指身体接触，但并不一定暗示渴望，而更暗示深情的愉悦：熟睡的小猫依偎在警惕的母亲身边。拥抱强调爱抚的一种可能性，特别指表达爱或渴望的手臂紧握。 hug 比 caress 或 foddle 甚至 cuddle 更加不正式，它似乎更适合表达更朴实的情感，尽管它与前面所有词语形成对比，强调的是感情的强烈程度而不是温柔程度：拼命地拥抱受伤的孩子；当他们到达公园僻静的地方时，立即转身拥抱对方。Dandle 可能是所有这些词中最具体的，最具体地限制为孩子在某人的腿上或膝盖上蹦蹦跳跳或摇晃：轻轻地抚摸孩子，同时她唱着活泼的童谣。

Pet, in its oldest sense, is close to fondle in indicating the stroking of a
body with one’s hand: petting the purring cat. In a more recent
quasi-slang sense, the word relates to caress and fondle, but more
specifically suggests in tense sexual play between lovers that stops
short of intercourse: teenagers who find that petting in the back seats
of cares only intensifies their natural frustrations. Neck is a slang term
that exclusively pertains to this last sense of pet, but usually suggests
kissing, and may imply greater restraint than pet: couples who sat in
the back circle of the theatre and spent more time necking than
watching the movie. Smooch is a slang term similar in meaning to
neck, but often suggesting slobbery comic awkwardness rather than
having sexual overtones, even if the affection is usually mutual.

Pet 最古老的意义与 fondle 相近，表示用手抚摸身体：抚摸呼噜呼噜的猫。在更近的俚语意义上，该词与 caress 和 fondle 有关，但更具体地指情侣之间紧张的性爱游戏，但未达到性交的程度：青少年发现在汽车后座抚摸只会加剧他们自然的挫败感。Neck 是俚语，专门指 pet 的最后一种意义，但通常表示亲吻，可能比 pet 更克制：情侣坐在剧院后排，花在亲吻上的时间比看电影的时间还多。Smooch 是俚语，含义与 neck 相似，但通常表示滑稽的尴尬，而不是性暗示，即使感情通常是相互的。

4.121 Caricature

These words refer to an exaggerated rendering of the recognizable
features of something in order to mock or poke fun at it. Caricature,
most specifically, refers to a drawing or cartoon of someone in which
salient features are distorted or overemphasized for comic effect. This
may be done in good-humoured fun or in an attempt at character
assassination: a room filled with caricatures of theatrical stars; a caricature that represented the distinguished statesman as a masked
gangster. The word can be used more widely of any production that
deliberately distorts the recognizable features of something for any
purpose: a novel that presents us with stereotyped caricatures rather
than living human beings. Send-up and take-off are the most
informal and general of any of these words, alluding to any
exaggerated imitation designed to hold up its original to ridicule: a skit
that was a send-up on the absurdities of several popular TV
programmes; a imaginary transcript of a press conference that was a
biting take-off on the real thing.

这些词指夸张地呈现某事物的可识别特征，以嘲笑或取笑它。漫画，最具体地说，是指某人的绘画或漫画，其中的显著特征被扭曲或过分强调以达到喜剧效果。这可能是为了幽默的乐趣，也可能是为了诽谤他人：一个房间里摆满了戏剧明星的漫画；一幅把杰出的政治家描绘成蒙面歹徒的漫画。这个词可以更广泛地用于任何为了任何目的而故意扭曲某事物可识别特征的作品：一部向我们展示刻板漫画而不是活生生的人的小说。Send-up 和 take-off 是这些词中最不正式和最普遍的，暗指任何旨在嘲笑原作的夸张模仿：一部讽刺几部热门电视节目荒谬之处的短剧；一份虚构的新闻发布会记录，与真实内容截然相反。

Mimicry, most specifically, suggests the exaggerated acting out of
another person’s mannerisms and speech patterns; as with caricature,
this may be done out of good humour or malice: his whining mimicry of
the professor’s voice; a series of impersonations in which his keen
sense for mimicry is expertly displayed. This word also is frequently
used for a wider range of exaggerated imitations: his devastating
mimicry of the worst features of Lawrence’s prose style. Sometimes the
word can be used for inept imitation of an admired figure or style: his
pitiful mimicry of upper-class manners.

模仿，最具体地指夸张地模仿他人的言行举止和说话方式；与漫画一样，模仿可能是出于好心情或恶意：他哀怨地模仿教授的声音；一系列模仿，巧妙地展示了他敏锐的模仿意识。这个词也经常用于更广泛的夸张模仿：他对劳伦斯散文风格中最糟糕的特征的毁灭性模仿。有时这个词可以用来形容对受人钦佩的人物或风格的拙劣模仿：他对上流社会礼仪的可怜模仿。

Burlesque suggests a rowdy or zany reduction to the absurd of the
content or style of some production or work, especially where the
original is afflicted with pomposity or excessive solemnity: a revue that
was a burlesque of the typically woebegone naturalistic play.
Sometimes, like caricature or mimicry, the word can indicate
specifically the satirizing of the characteristics or mannerisms of a
particular person: a figure in the novel that was clearly a burlesque of
a well-known feminist of that day. Parody most specifically suggests
the ridiculing of a literary work by an exaggerated imitation of its style:
a howling parody of Longfellow’s "Evangeline"; a virtuoso parody of the
author’s endlessly tortuous sentence structure. Where burlesque may
imply broad, slashing strokes applied slapdash, parody, by contrast,
more often suggests an extremely skilful and understated imitation
that is all the more effective for so cleverly catching the style of its
original. Sometimes parodies have been done so consummately as to
be mistakenly admired as a serious effort; this could almost never
happen with a burlesque.

滑稽戏是指将某些作品或作品的内容或风格粗暴或滑稽地简化为荒谬的，尤其是在原作浮夸或过度严肃的情况下：一场滑稽表演是对典型的悲哀自然主义戏剧的滑稽模仿。有时，像漫画或模仿一样，这个词可以专门表示对某个人的特征或举止的讽刺：小说中的人物显然是对当时一位著名女权主义者的滑稽模仿。戏仿最具体地是指通过夸张模仿文学作品的风格来嘲笑它：对朗费罗的《伊万杰琳》的嚎叫模仿；对作者无休止的曲折句子结构的精湛模仿。滑稽戏可能意味着粗暴、粗暴的粗略运用，而戏仿则相反，它更经常地暗示一种极其熟练和低调的模仿，这种模仿更能巧妙地捕捉原作的风格。有时戏仿做得如此完美，以至于被误认为是认真的作品；而滑稽戏几乎不会发生这种情况。

Travesty was once and is still rarely used, like burlesque or parody, to
suggest a broad or skilful mocking of someone else’s style. It is now
more often used to suggest an utterly inept or totally depraved
debasement of something admirable; a shocking travesty of impartial
judicial procedures. Sometimes, in its most hyperbolical uses, the
standard to which something is compared is not even indicated: The
whole concert was simply a travesty.

讽刺曾经很少被使用，就像滑稽戏或戏仿一样，用来表示对他人风格的广泛或巧妙的嘲弄。现在它更常被用来表示对令人钦佩的事物进行极其无能或完全堕落的贬低；对公正司法程序的令人震惊的讽刺。有时，在其最夸张的用法中，甚至没有指出比较的标准：整场音乐会简直就是一场讽刺。

4.122 Carry

These words are alike in referring to the moving of objects or
people through space. Carry and bear both suggest the supporting of
a load, but of the two only carry necessarily implies movement from
place to place. A donkey can bear a heavy load simply by standing still,
but carrying the load implies moving it somewhere: The bridge was
designed to bear the heaviest load any train could carry. Bear, of
course, can suggest movement as well, in which case a dignity of
comportment and style is suggested: the royal carriage bearing the
queen and her consort. Carry, on the other hand, need not necessarily
emphasize the heaviness of the thing being moved: carrying only a
small handbag and a pair of gloves. Bear has an additional connotation
of suffering not implied by carry: He bore with him all his life the
memory of her painful death.

这些词在指物体或人在空间中的移动时是相似的。Carry 和 bear 都表示支撑负载，但两者中只有 carry 必然意味着从一个地方移动到另一个地方。驴子只需静止站立就能承受重物，但 carrying 意味着将其移动到某个地方：这座桥的设计可以承受任何火车可以承载的最重负载。Bear 当然也可以表示移动，在这种情况下，它暗示着一种举止和风格的尊严：皇家马车载着女王和她的配偶。另一方面，Carry 不一定强调被移动物体的重量：只携带一个小手提包和一副手套。Bear 还有 carry 所没有暗示的痛苦的额外含义：他一生都背负着她痛苦死亡的记忆。

Transport and haul are more formal and technical than these;
transport is normally restricted to the shipment of goods or people
considered as fright, while haul refers only to freight: ships to transport
troops to the battlefield; semi-trailers to haul interstate freight.
Transport, more than carry and haul emphasizes movement to a goal
or destination. They contrast with the style implied in bear by stressing
the mere physical event of shipment as a problem in logistics.

运输和拖运比这些更正式、更专业；运输通常仅限于运送被视为恐怖的货物或人员，而拖运仅指货物：船只用于将部队运送到战场；半挂车用于运送州际货物。与运送和拖运相比，运输更强调到达目标或目的地。它们与 bear 所暗示的风格形成对比，强调运输这一纯粹的物理事件是物流中的问题。

Bring and take are the most informal of all these; bring refers to movement towards the speaker, take to movement away from the speaker. Both are often used imperatively: Take away this ghastly veal cutlet and bring me my slippers. In actual usage, the to or from distinction is not always observed; both may also imply an accompanied or guided movement rather than one in which one thing carries another. [Take me to the nearest hospital; The ski life will bring you within a few feet of the mountaintop.]

Bring 和 take 是所有动词中最不正式的；bring 指朝说话者移动，take 指远离说话者移动。这两个动词经常用作祈使句：把这块可怕的小牛排拿走，把我的拖鞋拿给我。在实际使用中，to 和 from 的区别并不总是很明显；这两个动词也可能表示伴随或引导的移动，而不是一个物体携带另一个物体的移动。[带我去最近的医院；滑雪场会带你到离山顶几英尺的地方。]

Convey was in Shakespeare’s time a simple synonym for bring or take. In this sense it is now extremely formal and is mainly used in referring to the transmitting of a message through an intermediary. [Convey my best wishes to the rest of your family; The ambassador personally conveyed the president’s message to the premier.] Convey does not necessarily imply actual movement. [If my letter conveyed the impression that I was indifferent, please forgive me; His tone conveyed his real feelings more truly than his words.]

在莎士比亚时代，“传达”只是带来或拿走的简单同义词。从这个意义上讲，它现在非常正式，主要用于指通过中间人传递信息。[向你全家转达我的良好祝愿；大使亲自向总理转达了总统的信息。]传达并不一定意味着实际的行动。[如果我的信给人留下了我漠不关心的印象，请原谅我；他的语气比他的话语更真实地传达了他的真实感受。]

4.123 Catastrophe

These words refer to misfortunes that result in grave loss or heavy casualties. Catastrophe is equally appropriate for a personal or public misfortune: taking along a first-aid kit to cope with unexpected catastrophe; air pollution that has reached the proportions of a catastrophe. In personal application, the word is often used hyperbolically of minor incidents: how to deal with the catastrophe of a large, visible run in her stocking. In reference to a general event, the word may refer to the negative effect on a particular group rather than to the public as a whole: a land reform programme that benefited the poor but was a catastrophe for rich landowners. Cataclysm is most sharply in contrast with these possibilities of catastrophe in allowing little use for personal misfortune and in restricting itself to severe mishaps that have negative results for everyone; it stresses, furthermore, a momentous disruption that results in severe damage and loss: a hairbreadth escape from nuclear cataclysm. More than these other words, cataclysm is especially suggestive of a natural upheaval: the extinct volcano’s eruption would mean a cataclysm for the city.

这些词指的是造成重大损失或重大伤亡的不幸。灾难同样适用于个人或公共的不幸：随身携带急救箱以应对意外灾难；空气污染已达到灾难的程度。在个人应用中，这个词通常用于夸张地描述小事件：如何处理袜子里明显大量破洞的灾难。在指代一般事件时，这个词可能指对特定群体而不是整个公众的负面影响：土地改革计划使穷人受益，但对富裕的地主来说却是一场灾难。灾难与这些灾难的可能性形成了最鲜明的对比，它很少允许个人不幸，并将自己限制在对每个人都有负面影响的严重事故上；此外，它强调的是导致严重破坏和损失的重大破坏：从核灾难中侥幸逃脱。与其他词语相比，“cataclysm”特别容易让人联想到自然灾害：死火山的喷发意味着城市的大灾变。

Disaster is the most general of these words, referring both to personal and public misfortunes in a wide range of possibilities: household disasters; a country afflicted with the twin disasters of food shortages and an exploding population. Like cataclysm, the word can refer to natural upheavals, but without the implications of total destruction present in cataclysm: a flood that was the worst disaster the city had ever faced. Disaster compares with catastrophe by stressing the actual harm done: They were glad they had survived the catastrophe and had met with no disaster. The word can, of course, be used hyperbolically, like catastrophe, for minor misfortunes: a party that turned out to be acomplete disaster.

灾难是这些词中最常用的，指各种可能性的个人和公共不幸：家庭灾难；一个国家遭受粮食短缺和人口爆炸的双重灾难。与大灾变一样，这个词可以指自然灾害，但不意味着大灾变中出现的彻底破坏：一场洪水是这座城市有史以来面临的最严重的灾难。灾难与灾难相比，强调的是实际造成的伤害：他们很高兴自己在灾难中幸存下来，没有遭遇灾难。当然，这个词也可以像灾难一样夸张地用来表示小不幸：一场聚会变成了一场彻底的灾难。

Calamity is similar to catastrophe, but at a reduced level of intensity. It may also now sound more formal than these other words, or at least shade outdated. It is more often used for a personal misfortune, seriously or hyperbolically, but it can also be used of public misfortunes on occasion, in which case it functions more abstractly or subjectively than disaster: a little calamity that happened on his way to school; a calamity that wiped out his savings; arguing that the bill’s passage would result in a calamity for the whole country. Debacle once referred specifically to a serious disruption or natural upheaval, as of a flood, especially when severe damage or failure results: the debacle of the Children’s Crusade; a stock-market debacle. Now, the word more often refers to an attempt that is ridiculously inept or that results in humiliating defeat: a high-level conference that was nothing short of adebacle.

Calamity 与 catastrophe 类似，但强度较低。​​现在，它听起来可能比其他词更正式，或者至少有点过时。它更常用于形容个人不幸，无论是严肃的还是夸张的，但有时也用于形容公众不幸，在这种情况下，它的功能比 disaster 更抽象或主观：上学路上发生的小灾难；一场让他的积蓄化为乌有的灾难；认为该法案的通过将导致整个国家的灾难。Debacle 曾经专门指严重的破坏或自然灾害，如洪水，尤其是造成严重破坏或失败时：儿童十字军的失败；股市崩溃。现在，这个词更多地指的是一次极其无能的尝试或导致惨败的尝试：一场完全是失败的高层会议。

4.124 Cautious

These words refer to thoughtful restraint in behaviour. Cautious is the most general of these, suggesting a careful holding back from action until all possibilities have been considered: a cautious attitude towards buying into his company. The word can, as well, suggest careful action, in which case it suggests a slow, tentative or even timid manner: his cautious crossing of the rickety bridge. Wary is an intensification of all the implications of cautious, stressing an extremely hesitant manner that sees every course of action fairly bristling with dangers: giving a wary reply to the enigmatic comment of the stranger; asking the campers to be particularly wary of starting a bush-fire during the dry season.
	
这些词指的是行为上的深思熟虑的克制。Cautious 是其中最普遍的一种，表示在考虑了所有可能性之前谨慎地不采取行动：对与他的公司合作持谨慎态度。这个词也可以表示谨慎的行为，在这种情况下，它表示一种缓慢、犹豫甚至胆怯的态度：他小心翼翼地穿过摇摇欲坠的桥梁。Wary 是 caution 所有含义的强化，强调一种极其犹豫的态度，认为每一种行动都充满危险：对陌生人的神秘评论做出谨慎的回答；要求露营者在旱季特别小心不要引发丛林火灾。	

Guarded also intensifies the implication of cautious, but puts special stress on a wary manner in social interchanges that is marked by a reluctance to reveal too much about oneself or give too much of oneself except to people with whom one is thoroughly familiar: a guarded, non-committal answer to the interviewer’s blunt questions. It may also suggest a deliberate suppression of one’s feelings for fear of having them proved wrong: a guarded optimism about the outcome of the election. Whereas the former words point to restrained behaviour that might result from fear, unfamiliarity, or uneasiness, prudent suggests action that is the outcome of wisdom gained by experience. Such action need not be cautious or wary at all; these words might, in fact, suggest the opposite of prudent when no real cause for fear exists: It was not prudent to be so cautious in climbing the slope, because it put her in constant danger of losing her balance.

Guarded 也强化了 caution 的含义，但特别强调社交交往中的谨慎态度，其特点是不愿透露太多自己的信息，也不愿向除了自己非常熟悉的人以外的人透露太多自己的信息：对面试官直截了当的问题谨慎而含糊的回答。它也可能暗示故意压抑自己的感情，因为害怕自己的感情被证明是错误的：对选举结果持谨慎乐观的态度。前一个词指的是可能因恐惧、不熟悉或不安而导致的克制行为，而 prudent 则暗示行动是从经验中获得的智慧的结果。这种行动根本不需要谨慎或警惕；事实上，当没有真正的恐惧原因时，这些词可能暗示 prudent 的反义词：爬坡时太小心是不明智的，因为这让她随时处于失去平衡的危险之中。

Circumspect and discreet both refer primarily to social behaviour. Circumspect indicates a strict adherence to social proprieties. [A prudent politician must perforce lead a rigorously circumspect life; if he cannot, he had best be cautious as to which temptations he permits himself to surrender to.] Discreet refers to a different kind of social propriety than circumspect, indicating an ability to keep the confidences of other people and to be extremely guarded about entrusting personal details to others: wondering how discreet her friend could be about what he knew of her past life. In a less specific use, discreet approaches the meaning of circumspect, suggesting a prudent choice of inoffensive behaviour or an ability to handle difficult matters with tact and delicacy. In this same the word nevertheless contrasts with circumspect in suggesting a more intuitive, less rigid approach to social behaviour.

Circumspect和discreet主要指社交行为。谨慎表示严格遵守社交礼仪。[谨慎的政治家必须过着严格谨慎的生活；如果他做不到，他最好谨慎地选择他允许自己屈服于哪些诱惑。]谨慎指的是一种不同于谨慎的社交礼仪，表示有能力保守别人的秘密，并且非常谨慎地将个人信息托付给他人：想知道她的朋友对她过去生活的了解有多谨慎。在一种不太具体的用法中，谨慎接近谨慎的含义，表明谨慎选择无害的行为或能够巧妙而巧妙地处理棘手的问题。然而，在同样的情况下，这个词与谨慎形成对比，表明一种更直观、不太僵硬的社交行为方式。

4.125 Cave

These words refer to a hollow or opening in the earth, either natural or artificial. Cave is least specific and can be applied to any hollowed-out area in the earth, usually one that occurs in the side of a mountain, cliff or hill. The cliff dwellers found that natural caves gave them warmth and protection during the Ice Age. Bears, for similar reasons, hibernate in caves during the winter.

这些词指的是地上的洞或洞，可以是天然的，也可以是人工的。洞穴是最不具体的，可以指地上任何挖空的区域，通常是山、悬崖或小山的一侧。在冰河时代，悬崖居民发现天然洞穴为他们提供了温暖和保护。出于类似的原因，熊在冬天在洞穴中冬眠。

Cavern, when used in place of cave, tends to sound inflated in diction. It can be used accurately, however, to refer to a more extensive subterranean cave or set of caves indefinite in extent, especially when it suggests a natural chamber such as one formed in limestone by running water. In this case, the sense of an opening into the slanted face of a hill is not necessarily maintained. One or more mouths of the cavern may open on to relatively level ground: The tourists clutched the guide-rail and of light. Cavern may be also used metaphorically for any obscure recess: the dark caverns of his mind.

Cavern 用来代替 cave，听起来语气有些夸张。但是，它可以准确地用来指代更大的地下洞穴或范围不定的洞穴群，尤其是当它暗示天然的洞穴，例如由流水在石灰岩中形成的洞穴时。在这种情况下，山坡上的开口感不一定能保持。洞穴的一个或多个入口可能通向相对平坦的地面：游客们紧紧抓住导轨和灯光。Cavern 也可以比喻任何隐蔽的凹处：他头脑中的黑暗洞穴。

Grotto is the most specific of these terms, though it can refer either to an artificial or natural hollow. When artificial, it is a cavelike, manmade structure built as a recreational retreat or shrine: The towns-people placed a Christmas tree within their quaintly decorated grotto and sang carols there throughout the holidays. When natural, a grotto is typically picturesque, often forming a recess in a cavern, one that may be filled with odd-shaped stalagmites and stalactites: Daylight has never touched the cave paintings in the grotto at Lascaux.

石窟是这些术语中最具体的，但它既可以指人造的洞穴，也可以指天然的洞穴。如果是人造的，它是一种洞穴状的人工建筑，作为休闲场所或神殿：镇上的人们在他们装饰古雅的石窟里放了一棵圣诞树，并在整个节日里唱颂歌。如果是天然的，石窟通常是风景如画的，通常形成洞穴中的凹处，里面可能充满了形状奇特的石笋和钟乳石：日光从未照过拉斯科洞穴中的洞穴壁画。

Burrow and tunnel are alike in suggesting an artificial opening in the earth and often implying a linear shape as contrasted with the roughly spherical hollow most typical of a cave. Burrow refers to the hollow dug by some animal such as a rabbit: The burrows of rabbits can cause erosion of pasture land. Tunnel can refer to a hollow in the earth dug by an animal, but it is used more frequently to refer to one dug by man. If its purpose is to permit movement from one point to another, as in a subway system, a tunnel would be mainly horizontal over most of its course. If dug for purposes of mining, a tunnel would usually slant sharply downwards into the depths of the earth: The miners were trapped in the tunnel by a cave-in along the passage just behind them.

洞穴 (Burrow) 和隧道 (tunnel) 相似，都指地球上的人工开口，且通常呈线状，与洞穴最典型的大致呈球形的凹陷形成对比。洞穴 (Burrow) 指的是兔子等动物挖的凹陷：兔子的洞穴会侵蚀牧场。隧道 (Tunnel) 可以指动物挖的地球上的凹陷，但它更常用于指人类挖的凹陷。如果隧道的目的是允许从一个点移动到另一个点，例如在地铁系统中，那么隧道在大部分路段上将主要是水平的。如果隧道是为了采矿而挖掘的，那么隧道通常会急剧向下倾斜到地球深处：矿工们被困在隧道中，因为他们身后的通道发生塌方。

4.126 Celebration

These words refer to joyful gatherings of people. Celebration and party are both general, suggesting any coming together of a number of people to rejoice over some happy event. Celebrations and parties can be large or small, public or private, formal or informal; but celebration usually connotes a large gathering and party a more intimate group, often of persons who are close friends or at least acquainted: the candidate’s victory celebration that drew nearly a thousand people; He felt fortunate to be a guest at one of her small, select dinner parties.Ball implies an official or stately occasion, and suggests a scrupulously selected guest list and formal attire: the debutante’s coming-out ball;the Lord Mayor’s Ball.

这些词指的是人们的欢乐聚会。Celebration 和 party 都是泛指，指许多人聚在一起庆祝某个快乐事件。庆祝活动和派对可大可小、可公开可私密、可正式可非正式；但 celebration 通常表示大型聚会，而 party 表示更亲密的团体，往往由亲密的朋友或至少是熟人组成：候选人的胜选庆祝活动吸引了近千人；他很幸运能成为她精心挑选的小型晚宴的嘉宾。Ball 表示正式或庄严的场合，并暗示精心挑选的宾客名单和正式着装：初入社交界的少女出道舞会；市长舞会。

Festival suggests the celebration of a whole community either periodically at a significant time of the year or on some important occasion: the town’s annual harvest festival. It is frequently applied to a planned series of cultural events: Sydney’s yearly Waratah Festival;
such lures for summer tourists as the Salzburg and Spoleto festivals. It is also used to describe annual religious ceremonies: the festival of Trinity Sunday. Feast, like festival, has a religious connotation: the feast of Palm Sunday. But in wider applications, it suggests a single celebration at which a great deal of food is eaten: all the knights and ladies gathering for a sumptuous feast. Outside a religious or historical context, the word may sound out-mode now, except in metaphorical or hyperbolically uses: That dinner you gave was a real feast. Banquet, in fact, has almost replaced feast in the sense of a formal or official dinner; it suggests the honouring of a special event or guest or the observing of an important occasion: After the wedding banquet, there will be a formal ball.

节日 (Festival) 表示整个社区在一年中的重要时刻或某个重要场合定期举行的庆祝活动：该镇一年一度的丰收节。它经常用于一系列计划中的文化活动：悉尼一年一度的瓦拉塔节 (Waratah Festival)；
萨尔茨堡和斯波莱托节等吸引夏季游客的节日。它也用于描述一年一度的宗教仪式：三一主日节。盛宴 (Feast) 与节日一样，具有宗教含义：棕榈主日节。但在更广泛的应用中，它表示一次吃大量食物的庆祝活动：所有骑士和女士聚集在一起享用丰盛的盛宴。在宗教或历史背景之外，这个词现在可能听起来过时了，除非用于比喻或夸张：你举办的那场晚宴是一场真正的盛宴。事实上，宴会 (Banquet) 几乎取代了盛宴 (feast)，作为正式或官方晚宴的意思；它表示对特殊活动或客人的尊重或庆祝重要场合：婚宴之后，将举行正式舞会。

Festivity is vaguer in reference than most of these related words. It now might sound like inflated diction when it replaces festival or, especially, party: promising to look in later on the festivities. It is still viable, however, in suggesting a mood of convivial merry-making: the air of festivity that even the smallest town takes on during Christmas.

与大多数相关词语相比，Festivity 的指称更为模糊。当它取代节日或派对时，听起来可能像是夸张的措辞：承诺稍后再去参加庆祝活动。然而，它仍然可行，因为它暗示了一种欢乐的气氛：即使是最小的城镇在圣诞节期间也会有欢乐的气氛。

4.127 Centre

These words refer to a position equidistant from the extremities or periphery, or to the vital part of something. Centre, most concretely, indicates such a point within the circumference of a circle or a sphere: the centre of the earth. It can, of course, suggest an approximate location of this sort within any configuration: at the centre of the intersection. Used metaphorically, it suggests a place of extreme density or importance: a metropolitan centre; at the very centre of his philosophy. Middle, most typically, indicates a point equidistant from the two ends of something: folding the paper down the middle. It can be used more loosely, as an informal substitute for centre, especially when an approximation is intended: right in the middle of the ocean. It is better used for a moment of time than centre: in the middle of the day. It can also indicate a point or moment that occurs in the thick of things: in the middle of our other troubles. Here, it suggests passivity as compared with centre: the man who was at the centre of the controversy. Midst is now mostly used in this last sense of middle but without the implication of passivity; even here it might sound excessively formal except in some standard expressions: in the midst of battle; in the midst of life.

这些词指的是与两端或边缘等距的位置，或与某物的重要部分等距的位置。中心，最具体地，表示圆或球的圆周内的这样一个点：地球的中心。当然，它可以表示任何配置中的这种近似位置：在交叉点的中心。用作比喻，它表示一个极其密集或重要的地方：大都市中心；在他的哲学的正中心。中间，最典型地，表示与某物两端等距的点：将纸从中间折叠。它可以更随意地使用，作为中心的非正式替代词，特别是当想要近似时：就在海洋的正中央。它比中心更适合用来表示片刻：在一天的中间。它还可以表示发生在事物最激烈时刻的点或时刻：在我们其他麻烦的中间。在这里，它表示与中心相比的被动性：处于争论中心的人。 Midst 现在主要用于最后一种中间含义，但没有被动的含义；即使在这里，除了一些标准表达之外，它可能听起来过于正式：在战斗中；在生活中。

Core specifically suggests the centre of a solid figure: an apple core; the hollow core of the building. Metaphorically, it has a wide range of uses suggesting the irreducible minimum or quintessence of something that may in its fullness be extensive and manifold: The core of our appeal is freedom of speech; the core of his argument. Heart, at its most concrete, contrasts with all these other words in referring to a vital organ rather than to an exact or approximate centre. In metaphorical uses, however, it may refer to the vital centre of something: the very heart of the city. It may also, like middle, refer approximately to the point of greatest density: in the heart of the jungle. In more abstract uses, it relates most closely to core in suggesting the sine qua non of something, although in this case the irreducible core is also seen as animating principle. [Magna Carta, signed by King John in 1215 under pressure from his barons, is the heart of British freedom and justice.]

Core 特指固体图形的中心：苹果核；建筑物的空心。从比喻上讲，它有广泛的用法，表示事物的不可简化的最小值或精髓，其完整度可能是广泛而多样的：我们呼吁的核心是言论自由；他的论点的核心。Heart，最具体的，与所有这些其他词形成对比，指的是重要器官，而不是确切或近似的中心。然而，在比喻用法中，它可能指事物的重要中心：城市的心脏。它也可能像 middle 一样，大致指密度最大的点：丛林的中心。在更抽象的用法中，它与 core 最密切相关，表示事物的必要条件，尽管在这种情况下，不可简化的核心也被视为有生命力的原则。[大宪章由约翰国王于 1215 年在男爵的压力下签署，是英国自由和正义的核心。]

Hub, most concretely, refers to the centre of a wheel; in metaphorical uses, it may refer to the psychological centre of a city, even one laid out on a grid system: the hub of business activity in Melbourne. The word seems more exactly used when a network with radiating arms is suggested: the hub of the cocktail party around whom the lesser known spread out in diminishing rank.

Hub 最具体地指的是车轮的中心；在比喻用法中，它可能指的是城市的心理中心，即使是按网格系统布局的城市：墨尔本的商业活动中心。当提到具有辐射臂的网络时，这个词似乎更准确地使用：鸡尾酒会的中心，鲜为人知的人围绕着它，等级逐渐降低。

4.128 Chance
	
These words refer to what occurs either unexpectedly or without pre-arrangement or plan. Chance is the least formal of these. On one hand it can indicate coincidence: a chance meeting in the street. On the other, it can suggest an occurrence that is governed by no known physical laws: the development of quantum theory to explain seemingly chance events in the interaction of atomic particles. Accidental stresses the lack of intention or forethought, but is now strongly influenced by accident, meaning mishap, to suggest an error that brings undesirable or even disastrous results: an accidental misreading of her bank balance; the spectre of an accidental nuclear holocaust. Fortuitous can point to something that is apparently without cause or design, but it often suggests a good or desirable occurrence, an overtone that puts the word in the strongest possible contrast with accidental: a fortuitous change of plan that kept them out of the city during the accidental blackout.

这些词指的是意外发生或没有预先安排或计划的事情。Chance 是这些词中最不正式的。一方面，它可以表示巧合：街上的偶然相遇。另一方面，它可以暗示一种不受已知物理定律支配的事件：量子理论的发展解释了原子粒子相互作用中看似偶然的事件。Accidental 强调缺乏意图或深思熟虑，但现在受到 accident（意为不幸事件）的强烈影响，暗示一种带来不良甚至灾难性后果的错误：意外读错了银行存款余额；意外核浩劫的幽灵。Fortuitionous 可以指向显然没有原因或设计的事情，但它通常暗示一种好的或可取的事件，这种含义使这个词与 accidental 形成了最强烈的对比：意外改变计划，使他们在意外停电期间无法进入城市。

Contingent can refer, most simply, to what is unexpected or unforeseen: a contingent thunderstorm that scattered the marchers. More often, the word points to something that is dependent on an uncertain event or condition; in this case the word is used with on or upon: an increase in your allowance that is contingent upon how well you do in your studies.

Contingent 最简单的意思就是指意外或无法预见的事情：一场偶然的雷雨驱散了游行者。更常见的是，这个词指的是依赖于不确定事件或条件的事物；在这种情况下，这个词与 on 或 upon 连用：你的津贴增加取决于你的学习成绩。

Incidental points to something occurring without design or regularity: an incidental shrub or two beside the path. Thus, the word can refer to something unplanned or unexpected, but usually of value, however sight, especially when this is a concomitant or side benefit gained in the pursuit of some other goal: an incidental knowledge of Montagnard folksongs gained during his service in Vietnam. Adventitious can be a much more formal substitute for incidental, pointing to a fortuitous acquisition or coming together: adventitious circumstances that encouraged the rise of capitalism. Like incidental, the word can also indicate something that is not inherent, particularly something that is extrinsic to a primary consideration: adventitious flaws that did not detract from the power of the time-battered piece of sculpture.

偶然是指无计划或无规律地发生的事情：路边偶然出现的一两棵灌木。因此，这个词可以指计划外或意外发生的事情，但通常很有价值，无论多么不起眼，尤其是当这是在追求其他目标时获得的附带利益或附带利益时：在越南服役期间偶然了解到的山地民歌。偶然可以更正式地替代偶然，指的是偶然的获得或偶然的相遇：偶然的情况促进了资本主义的兴起。与偶然一样，这个词也可以表示非固有的东西，特别是与主要考虑无关的东西：偶然的缺陷并没有削弱这件历经时间考验的雕塑作品的力量。

4.129 Change
These words all refer to the process of making something over or making it different. Change, the most general and least formal, can mean any process of differentiation, slight or great, in appearance or essence, in quality or quantity: changing the desert into farmland; changing his mind; changing the way she wore her hair.

这些词都指改造或改变某事物的过程。改变是最普遍、最不正式的，可以指任何差异化过程，无论是微小的还是巨大的，外观或本质的，质量或数量的：把沙漠变成农田；改变他的思想；改变她的发型。

Alter, convert and modify suggest relatively slight revisions of something, generally in appearance or use. Each also has a use with somewhat different effect for a change in attitude or belief. As listed, these words move from the slightly to the highly formal, with perhaps a similar progression in implication, from lesser to greater change. Alter, most commonly, refers to changing the fit of clothes, either making them looser or tighter by letting out or taking in seams: the dressmaker who altered the hemline of the skirt. It also commonly refers to the redecoration of buildings: workmen altering the bookshop into a self-service grocery. In both these uses, alter implies that the basic structure is worked with and around rather than changed in itself, although no value judgement is present concerning the result. Alter, more than any of these words except change, has a wide range of application. [He altered his stand on birth control; She altered the mistake on the price tag.] Covert suggests the adaptation of an object by a specially designed addition that will increase its usefulness: an attachment that converts your vacuum cleaner into a paint sprayer. When used of attitudes or beliefs, convert suggests a far more drastic change than alter: the man who was converted to Buddhism. Modify, when used of objects, suggests more basic changes than alter or convert, in which function more importantly than appearance is changed: car aerials modified by teenagers into lethal weapons. When applied to attitudes, however, modify implies less change than either alter or convert. It often has a special overtone of making less extreme. [He didn’t alter his position so much as modify its severity; in any case, you could hardly say he was converted by the arguments of the opposition.]

Alter、convert 和modify 表示对某事物相对轻微的修改，通常是外观或用途上的修改。每个词也有不同的用法，表示态度或信念的改变。如所列，这些词从轻微到非常正式，含义可能也有类似的递进，从较小到较大变化。Alter 最常见的是指改变衣服的合身度，通过放宽或收紧接缝使衣服变松或变紧：裁缝师修改了裙子的下摆。它也常指建筑物的重新装修：工人们把书店改造成自助杂货店。在这两种用法中，alter 都意味着对基本结构进行加工和处理，而不是改变其本身，尽管对结果没有价值判断。Alter 比除change 之外的任何这些词都具有广泛的应用范围。[他改变了他对生育控制的立场；她修改了价格标签上的错误。]Covert 表示通过专门设计的附加装置对物体进行改造，以增加其实用性：将吸尘器改造成喷漆器的附件。当用于态度或信仰时，convert 比 alter 暗示着更剧烈的变化：皈依佛教的人。当用于物体时，modify 比 alter 或 convert 暗示着更基本的变化，其中功能比外观更重要的变化：青少年将汽车天线改装成致命武器。然而，当用于态度时，modify 暗示的变化比 alter 或 convert 要小。它通常具有使极端化程度降低的特殊含义。[他并没有改变自己的立场，而是改变了立场的严重性；无论如何，你很难说他是被反对派的论点所改变的。]

The remaining words suggest more drastic changes than the preceding, changes so profound that an entirely new entity may appear to have taken the place of the old. Transmute emphasizes an elemental change in the inner structure of a material, often implying a move from a lower to a higher state: coal transmuted to diamonds by aeons of intense pressure; alchemists vainly trying to transmute lead into gold. Change of this magnitude, obviously, is not accomplished by revision, as in alter, or by addition, as in convert. Transform suggests change equally as profound, but, in concentrating on outward form or appearance, it is perhaps slightly less intense than transmute and certainly more general. Transform may suggest change in a person or a definite entity, transmute in a less well-defined quantity; transmute also tends to suggest a slow, analysable or scientific process, transform a sudden or mystical change: the frog that was transformed into a prince; plans that were transformed overnight into reality. Transform also lends itself to hyperbole, perhaps overused: lighted candles that transformed the oak table into elegant dining table.

剩下的词语所表示的变化比前面的词语更为剧烈，变化如此深刻，以至于似乎有一个全新的实体取代了旧实体。Transmute 强调材料内部结构的元素变化，通常意味着从较低状态到较高状态的转变：煤炭经过漫长的高压变为钻石；炼金术士徒劳地试图将铅变为黄金。显然，这种程度的变化不是通过修改（如 alter）或添加（如 convert）来实现的。Transform 所表示的变化同样深刻，但在关注外在形式或外观时，它可能不如 transmute 如此强烈，而且肯定更为笼统。Transform 可能表示一个人或一个确定的实体的变化，transmute 的数量定义不太明确；transmute 也倾向于表示缓慢、可分析或科学的过程，transform 表示突然或神秘的变化：青蛙变成了王子；计划一夜之间变成了现实。转变也带有夸张的意味，甚至可能用得太多了：点燃蜡烛，橡木桌子就变成了优雅的餐桌。

Transfigure intensifies the mystical element in transform, adding a note of supernatural or religious rapture: the statue of St. Teresa transfigure by ecstasy. When used hyperbolically of more common circumstances, a positive or joyful change is indicated: her plain features transfigured with tenderness. Transmogrify, on the other hand, always stresses negative change, bizarre or ugly: the peasant lad transmogrified into a dragon. In more usual circumstances, the effect is comic: the graceful child transmogrified into a gangling adolescent.

变形强化了变形中的神秘元素，增添了超自然或宗教狂喜的气息：圣特蕾莎雕像因狂喜而变形。当在更常见的情形中夸张地使用时，表示积极或快乐的变化：她朴素的面容因温柔而变形。另一方面，变形总是强调负面的变化，怪异或丑陋：农民男孩变形为龙。在更常见的情况下，效果是喜剧性的：优雅的孩子变形为瘦长的青少年。

4.130 Characteristic
These words all refer to an aspect that is an identifiable part of a person, place, mood or object. Characteristic may imply neutral description in referring to any aspect of something, without evaluating its relative importance to the whole: a psychological report that lists every possible characteristic of the person being studied. More often, however, the word suggests an aspect of the whole that is regarded as typical: a town that had all the characteristics of a typical seaside resort; the preponderance of characteristic that supported the diagnosis of alcoholism. The word has many scientific or technical uses in this sense, but may be overused in other contexts where a less formal word is available.

这些词都指人、地方、情绪或物体的可识别部分。特征可能意味着中性描述，指代某事物的任何方面，而不评估其对整体的相对重要性：一份列出被研究者所有可能特征的心理报告。然而，更常见的是，这个词指的是整体中被认为是典型的一个方面：一个拥有典型海滨度假胜地所有特征的小镇；支持酗酒诊断的主要特征。这个词在这个意义上有许多科学或技术用途，但在其他有不太正式的词可用的语境中可能会被过度使用。

Attribute may escape the charge of inflated diction or imprecise jargon when used in place of characteristic for non-technical situations. It also may be used to refer to something typical, but, while being positive rather than negative, it leans perhaps to greater neutrality in suggesting one of many possible aspects that make up a whole: eagerness to learn, an often overlooked attribute in small children. Peculiarity, on the other hand, is far from neutral in suggesting an unpleasant attribute that is quite noticeable: a peculiarity in his shuffling walk; a peculiarity of mind that insisted on an exact order in doing even the smallest task; a peculiarity of the northern climate.

在非技术性情况下，当用“特性”代替“特性”时，特性可能避免被指责为用词夸大或术语不精确。特性也可用于指代典型事物，但尽管是正面的而非负面的，但它在暗示构成整体的许多可能方面之一时可能更偏向中性：好学，这是小孩子经常被忽视的特性。另一方面，特性远非中性，它暗示了一种非常明显的令人不快的特性：他走路时拖着脚步的特性；他思维方式的特殊性，即使是最小的任务也坚持按部就班；北方气候的特性。

Feature and mark, like peculiarity, refer to something quite noticeable, but feature more readily suggests something positive, while mark may suggest wither positive or negative aspects. Feature most specifically refers to physical appearance: an aquiline nose that was her beat feature. In more general uses, it may refer to an unusual or outstanding aspect of something: the siesta that is a distinguishing feature of life in Mexico. In the entertainment or advertising worlds, the word is used to refer to a special or added attraction: the feature of the vening’s entertainment; the new model’s compactness as an added feature. Mark is stronger than feature in suggesting something that sets its possessor apart: generosity as the mark of a civilized man. But it has negative uses that compare with peculiarity: the sadism that is the disfiguring mark of all fascist régimes. In the use, mark differs from peculiarity in suggesting an intrinsic rather than accidental or external departure from the norm.

特征和标记，像独特性一样，指代非常引人注目的事物，但特征更容易暗示积极方面，而标记则可能暗示积极或消极方面。特征最具体地指外貌：鹰钩鼻是她最突出的特征。在更一般的用法中，它可能指事物不寻常或突出的方面：午睡是墨西哥生活的显著特征。在娱乐或广告界，这个词用于指代特殊或附加的吸引力：晚会娱乐的特色；新车型的紧凑性作为附加功能。标记比特征更能暗示拥有者与众不同的东西：慷慨是文明人的标志。但它有与独特性相比的消极用法：虐待狂是所有法西斯政权的丑陋标志。在使用上，标记与独特性不同，它暗示的是内在的，而不是偶然或外在的偏离常态。

Trait and quality refer to more abstract attributes than peculiarity, feature or mark. Trait, most specifically, is used to describe abiding behaviour patterns, rather than single or momentary actions: a trait of suspiciousness that underlay all his relationships with people; traits of fortitude and industry that spelled survival for the settlers of a new colony. Quality is more general than any of the other words here; it may suggest a momentary aspect or an abiding one; it may suggest positive or negative attributes. It may imply measurable, concrete aspects, but is often used, contrarily, to suggest a vague or subtle gathering of impressions: a quality of despair in her drawn face; a strange quality of light in the room; qualities of exuberance and spontaneity that made the people easy to live with.

特质和品质指的是比特性、特征或标记更抽象的属性。特质最具体地用于描述持久的行为模式，而不是单一或瞬间的行为：怀疑的特质是他与人之间所有关系的基础；坚韧和勤奋的特质是新殖民地定居者生存的基础。品质比这里的任何其他词都更笼统；它可能表示瞬间的方面或持久的方面；它可能表示积极或消极的属性。它可能意味着可衡量的具体方面，但通常反过来用来表示模糊或微妙的印象的汇集：她憔悴的脸上流露出绝望的神色；房间里光线奇怪；热情和自发的品质使人们易于相处。

4.131 Charming
All these words are superlatives used mainly to describe the pleasing manner of an attractive person, usually a woman. Charming emphasizes gracious behaviour or elegance of manner, especially in social situations: Her charming considerateness made everyone feel at ease. It applies readily to feminine accomplishments or apparel: a charming table setting; a charming gown. Used of men, it suggests sophistication and suavity: the charming man with the slight French accent. Originally it suggested being put under a magic charm; the force of this original meaning is still felt, perhaps, when the word refers to a beautiful scene or landscape: the charming mountain views we glimpsed through the windows of our train.

所有这些词都是最高级的，主要用于描述有魅力的人（通常是女性）的令人愉悦的举止。Charming 强调举止优雅或举止高雅，尤其是在社交场合：她迷人的体贴让每个人都感到轻松自在。它很容易适用于女性的才华或服饰：迷人的餐桌布置；迷人的礼服。用于男性，它暗示着老练和温文尔雅：带有轻微法国口音的迷人男士。它最初暗示被施了魔法；当这个词指美丽的景色或景观时，这个原意的力量也许仍然可以感受到：我们透过火车窗户瞥见的迷人山景。

Bewitching, enchanting and entrancing also once suggested being put under a magic spell. Now, used to describe an attractive woman, they do not suggest social grace so much as qualities of freshness, strangeness or exotic allure, all considerably less innocuous than anything implied by charming. One might call the girl next door charming, for all her simplicity, but one would think twice about calling her bewitching ?unless one lived in a rather unusual neighbourhood. Bewitching most strongly suggests this exotic quality; enchanting,through overuse, is more innocuous than its two companions ?shading off towards charming. Entrancing still has some of its freshness left, suggesting an ability to command an onlooker’s stunned, almost hypnotized, attention: stupidly staring back at every entrancing smile she gave him. The same scale of forces for these three prevails when they are used to describe scenery. None of them would be a likely description for a man.

迷人、迷人和迷人也曾经暗示被施了魔法。现在，当它们用来形容一位有魅力的女性时，它们并不暗示社交风度，而是暗示清新、奇特或异国风情的品质，所有这些都远没有迷人所暗示的任何无害性。人们可能会称隔壁的女孩很单纯，但她很迷人，但除非住在一个相当不寻常的街区，否则人们会三思而后行称她为迷人。迷人最强烈地暗示了这种异国情调；迷人由于过度使用，比它的两个同伴更无害——逐渐趋向迷人。迷人仍然保留着一些新鲜感，暗示着能够引起旁观者的震惊、几乎被催眠的注意：傻乎乎地回望她给他的每一个迷人的微笑。当这三个词被用来描述风景时，它们的力量同样占主导地位。它们都不适合用来描述一个男人。

Captivating and winning suggest a different and fainter submerged metaphor ?of military conquest. They might both be most precisely used to imply an initial resistance on the part of the onlooker. Winning, however, suggests warm-hearted sunniness of disposition, whereas captivating carries an overtone of sexual allure and vivacity. Winning,also, might pertain to a single act, while captivating might apply more easily to a whole manner of behaviour: her winning appeal to him for help; his fading resistance to the captivating figure she made, standing alone and silent on the moonlit piazza. Both of these words may describe men, in which case an attempted conquest of a woman is implied, winning referring to an ingratiating pleasantness of manner and captivating to a rakish insouciance. [She forgot his winning courtesy and consideration in a twinkling when she saw the captivating smile of the man who drove by in the white convertible.] Winning would have little use in describing scenery, but captivating might suggest a collection of fanciful qualities that sweep one away in spite of one’s distrust for the stranger or unusual: one of thousands who surrendered whole-heartedly to the captivating uniqueness of Venice.

Captivating 和winning 暗示着一种不同的、更隐晦的隐喻——军事征服。它们可能都最准确地用来暗示旁观者最初的抵抗。然而，Winning 暗示着热情开朗的性格，而 captivating 则带有性诱惑和活力的意味。Winning 也可能指单一行为，而 captivating 可能更容易适用于整个行为方式：她向他求助，向他求助；他对她那迷人的身影的抵抗逐渐消退，她独自一人默默地站在月光下的广场上。这两个词都可以描述男人，在这种情况下暗示着对女人的征服企图，winning 指的是讨好的态度，captivating 指的是放荡不羁的无忧无虑。 [当她看到开着白色敞篷车经过的男人迷人的微笑时，她一瞬间就忘记了他迷人的礼貌和体贴。]迷人对于描述风景没有多大用处，但迷人可能暗示着一系列奇妙的品质，尽管人们对陌生人或不寻常的人不信任，但这些品质仍会将人吸引住：成千上万的人全心全意地屈服于威尼斯迷人的独特性。

Fascinating is beginning to suffers as much from overuse as a superlative as these other words. Although more general in application, it still can suggest, like entrancing, a prospect that is almost hypnotic in its inviting quality. It applies to men as well as to women, to any attractive scene or view, or to any idea or thing that is extremely nteresting. In all cases it is like captivating and winning in suggesting the ability to overcome resistance, however, strong: Against his will, he found himself caught up again and again in the life of this most
fascinating of peoples.

与其他词语一样，Fascinating 也开始因为过度使用而遭受损失。虽然它的用法更为广泛，但它仍然可以像 entrancing 一样，暗示一种几乎具有催眠般的诱惑力的前景。它适用于男性和女性，适用于任何迷人的场景或景色，或任何极其有趣的想法或事物。在所有情况下，它都像 captivating 一样，在暗示克服阻力的能力方面很有吸引力，无论阻力有多大：他发现自己一次又一次地陷入了这个最迷人的民族的生活。

4.132 Chaste
These words refer to the abstinence from immoral thoughts and actions, especially those of a sexual nature. Chaste is most often taken to mean abstinence from sexual activity of any sort: men who consort with promiscuous women but insist on marrying one who has been chaste. The word has a wider range of use, however: chaste in thought,word and deed. It can also refer to a married person who refrains from committing adultery: a chaste wife; Her husband had remained chaste largely through lack of opportunity. While humorous, the last example indicates that chaste can be taken as indicating mere lack of activity. Generally speaking, where action is concerned, self-restraint or self-denial is, in fact, usually implied as necessary in maintaining chaste behaviour. But chaste thoughts would be those completely and naturally free of sensual or sexual desire. Chaste can also refer to whatever is self-restrained, free of frivolity, and spare or severe in effect: a chaste prose style that was striking in its simplicity and clarity.	

这些词指的是禁绝不道德的思想和行为，尤其是性方面的思想和行为。贞洁通常是指禁绝任何形式的性行为：与放荡的女人交往但坚持要娶贞洁的女人为妻的男人。然而，这个词的用法更广泛：思想、言语和行为都贞洁。它也可以指已婚者不犯通奸罪：贞洁的妻子；她的丈夫之所以保持贞洁，主要是因为缺乏机会。虽然很幽默，但最后一个例子表明，贞洁可以理解为仅仅表示缺乏活动。一般来说，就行动而言，自我克制或自我否定通常被认为是保持贞洁行为的必要条件。但贞洁的思想是完全自然地摆脱感官或性欲的思想。贞洁还可以指任何自我克制、没有轻浮、效果简朴或严厉的事物：一种简洁明了的纯洁散文风格。

Pure emphasizes what has never been adulterated by immoral or sexual strivings. In this it is like chaste as it applies to thought, but here, pure can apply to the whole range of possibilities with this emphasis: the pure in spirit; He insisted that even the purest infant had already been tainted with original sin. Virtuous is much milder in its force than either pure or chaste, pointing to someone who refrains from immoral actions. With this word, the stress is less exclusively on sexual behaviour, indicating a generally moral or decent behaviour: the virtuous citizens of his hometown; those who are blessed with a virtuous husband or wife.

纯洁强调的是从未被不道德或性欲所玷污。在这方面，它与贞洁一样适用于思想，但在这里，纯洁可以适用于所有可能性，重点是：精神上的纯洁；他坚持认为，即使是最纯洁的婴儿也已经被原罪所玷污。有德行的力度比纯洁或贞洁要温和得多，指的是那些不做不道德行为的人。这个词的重点不完全是性行为，而是表明一种普遍的道德或正派行为：家乡的有德行的公民；有德行丈夫或妻子的人。

Continent refers strictly to refraining from acting upon desires or needs. Where sexuality is concerned, a person might not be pure in feeling or chaste in his imaginings and yet be continent if he successfully resists actual physical activity: She insisted that they remain continent until they were engaged to be married. In addition to sexuality, resistance to other appetites may be indicated by the word; here moderation rather than abstinence may be the point of its use: the alcoholic who found it impossible to be continent at a cocktail party; ex-servicemen’s re-unions at which few remain continent. The aspect of control is especially evident in a related use, pertaining to the ability to retain bodily discharges: devices to help bed-wetters become continent.

节制严格指克制自己不去满足欲望或需要。就性而言，一个人即使感情不纯洁，想象也不贞洁，但如果他能成功抵制实际的身体活动，他仍然能节制：她坚持要他们保持节制，直到订婚。除了性之外，这个词还可以表示对其他欲望的抵制；在这里，节制而不是禁欲可能是这个词的用意：在鸡尾酒会上无法保持节制的酒鬼；退伍军人聚会上很少有人能保持节制。控制的方面在相关用途中尤其明显，涉及保留身体排泄物的能力：帮助尿床者节制的装置。

4.133 Chatter
These words all refer to confused, rapid, incoherent or worthless talk. Chatter is the most general of these; it may refer to quick rambling talk that is light, idle or inconsequential, or it may refer to a din of voices all speaking at once: the man who pretended to listen silently as his wife chattered on and on; the women chattering in the backyard like a flock of magpies. The word is perhaps most appropriate to describe women’s or children’s voices, since a high-pitched quality of speech is usually implied. Babble suggests the almost idiotically meandering talk of a person or group of persons, without reference to sex: the drunkard who babbled out his life history to everyone in the crowded bar; the spectators in the gallery whose combined voices babbled in one continuous uproar.

这些词都指混乱、快速、不连贯或毫无意义的谈话。Chatter 是这些词中最普遍的；它可以指快速、漫无边际的、轻松、无聊或无关紧要的谈话，也可以指一群人同时说话的喧闹声：男人假装一声不吭，听着妻子喋喋不休；女人在后院像一群喜鹊一样喋喋不休。这个词也许最适合用来描述女人或孩子的声音，因为通常暗示说话声音尖锐。Babble 指的是一个人或一群人几乎白痴般漫无边际的谈话，不涉及性别：醉汉在拥挤的酒吧里向每个人喋喋不休地讲述自己的人生经历；观众在楼座上合在一起喋喋不休，一片喧闹。

Jabber is a jocose, slangy way of referring to rapid interchanges of a conversation one doesn’t understand or considers trivial: two merchants jabbering away in their bargaining for the cheer delight of hearing their own voices. The suggestion is even stronger in this word of a frenetic pace without respite. Gibber, however, is more strongly pejorative than jabber when applied to people. It suggests that the sounds produced are literally meaningless: a gibbering idiot; dancer who gibbered in grunts and groans that kept time with the music. The word may be purely descriptive when applied to animals: monkeys gibbering back and forth in the branches overhead. Prattle shares with jabber and gibber suggestions of unintelligible sounds, but if confined to children or sound in nature, the result is not pejorative: a baby prattling contentedly in his cot; a lazy waterfall that prattled to itself all day. If used of adult speech, of course, the word suggests stupidity or childishness: the old man who prattled to himself on the park bench.

jabber 是一种开玩笑的俚语，指的是人们听不懂或认为无关紧要的快速对话：两个商人为了听到自己的声音而喋喋不休地讨价还价。这个词暗示着一种无休止的疯狂节奏。然而，当用于人时，Gibber 的贬义比 jabber 更强烈。它暗示发出的声音毫无意义：一个喋喋不休的白痴；舞者随着音乐的拍子咕哝着咕哝的声音。这个词用于动物时可能纯粹是描述性的：猴子在头顶的树枝上叽叽喳喳地走来走去。Prattle 与 jabber 和 gibber 一样，都暗示着难以理解的声音，但如果仅限于儿童或自然界中的声音，结果就不是贬义的：一个婴儿在婴儿床上心满意足地喋喋不休；一座懒洋洋的瀑布整天喋喋不休。当然，如果用于成人的言语中，这个词就暗示着愚蠢或幼稚：在公园的长椅上喋喋不休的老人。

In prate, the suggestion of frenetically paced group speech present in chatter and babble is absent, as well as the unintelligibility present in those words grouped with babble. Prate, on the contrary, most readily suggests a tedious, long-winded monologue full of the speaker’s self-importance: a teacher who prates on disconnectedly but relentlessly about everything that comes into his head. Yak is a slang word for conversation that is neither necessarily hectic nor unintelligible; it suggests, instead, a contented, relaxed flow of talk that is idle or trivial: His favourite pastime at university was yakking with friends till all hours of the night. The word can also carry a pejorative implication, in which case constant, frenetic and noisy talk may be indicated: He was nearly driven mad by the way his wife yakked at him without pause.

在 prate 中，没有喋喋不休中那种节奏急促的集体讲话的感觉，也没有那些与喋喋不休组合在一起的单词的含糊不清的感觉。相反，prate 最容易让人联想到冗长乏味的独白，充满了说话者的自负：一位老师喋喋不休地喋喋不休，但坚持不懈地谈论着他想到的一切。Yak 是一个俚语，指的是既不忙乱也不晦涩难懂的谈话；相反，它指的是一种满足、轻松的谈话，这种谈话是无聊或琐碎的：他在大学里最喜欢的消遣是和朋友们聊天到深夜。这个词也可以带有贬义，在这种情况下，可能表示持续不断、疯狂和吵闹的谈话：他几乎被妻子不停地对他喋喋不休的样子逼疯了。

4.134 Cheat
These words refer to deliberate attempts to gain something from another by unfair or dishonest scheming or dissembling. Cheat is relatively informal and victimize relatively formal, but both are general in their application, indicating any situation where one person preys upon someone else. Cheat, in its transitive use, always implies a victim, although the act indicated may range from the mildly unfair to the outrageously unjust or heinous: The boy cheated his friend out of the apple by insisting that it was rotten, if not poisonous; a real-estate agent who cheated the widow out of the land on which oil had been discovered. As can be seen, cheat usually implies deception or breaking of generally accepted rules; victimize does not specify the means used to prey on the other person. The word can, in fact, apply to situations where nothing is to be gained but sadistic pleasure: a bully who victimized the other children after school. The word does stress the harm done to the victim and is consequently the harshest word here in its disapproval, whether or not tangible gain is implied: gangsters who victimized a whole city with their ten-year reign of terror.

这些词指的是通过不公平或不诚实的阴谋或伪装，故意试图从他人身上获取某种东西。Cheat 相对不正式，而 victimize 相对正式，但两者在应用上都很普遍，表示一个人掠夺他人的任何情况。Cheat 在及物动词中的用法总是暗示受害者，尽管所指的行为可能从轻微不公平到极其不公平或令人发指：这个男孩骗走了他朋友的苹果，因为他坚持说苹果已经烂了，甚至有毒；一个房地产经纪人骗走了寡妇发现石油的土地。可以看出，cheat 通常意味着欺骗或违反普遍接受的规则；victimize 并没有具体说明用来掠夺他人的手段。事实上，这个词可以适用于除了虐待狂的快感之外一无所获的情况：一个在放学后欺负其他孩子的恶霸。这个词确实强调了对受害者造成的伤害，因此在这里它是最严厉的反对词，不管是否暗示有形的利益：歹徒用他们十年的恐怖统治使整个城市成为受害者。

Swindle more specifically points to a scheme, often complicated, by which someone is cheated: a famous stock-market racket that swindled investors by means of forged shared certificates. Often, the word point to the cheating of gullible people who are persuaded to part with their valuables by trickery or deception or by appeals to their cupidity: confidence men who swindle unsuspecting investors with get-rich-quick propositions. Defraud suggest the use of less complex stratagems to divest someone of his valuables; the word can more often suggest a quick or one-time action accomplished through simple misrepresentation or lying: door-to-door salesmen who defraud housewives by taking orders for vacuum cleaners that they never intend to deliver.

诈骗更具体地指一种欺骗他人的计划，这种计划通常很复杂：一个著名的股票市场诈骗团伙，通过伪造共享证书来欺骗投资者。通常，这个词指的是那些容易上当的人被骗，他们被欺骗或欺骗，或被贪婪所吸引，放弃他们的贵重物品：骗子用快速致富的提议来欺骗毫无戒心的投资者。欺诈是指使用不太复杂的诡计来剥夺某人的贵重物品；这个词更常见的意思是通过简单的虚假陈述或谎言完成的快速或一次性行动：上门推销员通过接受他们永远不会打算交付的吸尘器订单来欺骗家庭主妇。

Fleece and con are both extremely informal words for cheat or swindle. Fleece suggests the same kind of complicated scheme as is indicated by swindle; by implication, the victim here is seen to be naïve and innocent as a lamb: an avid art collector who was fleeced of a million dollars by a ring that sold counterfeit paintings attributed to Impressionist masters. The word can be reduced in force to apply to any outrageous price obtained for cheap goods or services: tourist attractions set up to fleece the unwary sightseer. Con is a slang term that derives from confidence game, in which someone is swindled by gaining his trust. The word applies to situations in which the victimizer has a smooth line and a sympathetic manner that wins the confidence of his victim: a man who would con his own mother out of her last dollar. The word has become a fad word for any sort of insincerity that is put on to persuade or win the sympathy of someone else, even where no ostensible gain is in the offing: a drunkard who tried to con all his friends into pitying the hard luck he had met with in his life.

Fleece 和 con 都是非常不正式的欺骗或诈骗用词。Fleece 所暗示的复杂阴谋与 swindle 所暗示的相同；从言外之意看，这里的受害者天真无邪：一个狂热的艺术品收藏家被一个出售假冒印象派大师作品的团伙骗走了一百万美元。这个词可以简化为任何以低廉的价格获得的廉价商品或服务：为欺骗粗心大意的游客而设立的旅游景点。Con 是一个俚语，源于信心游戏，指某人通过赢得信任而被骗。这个词适用于施害者言辞流利、举止富有同情心，从而赢得受害者信任的情况：一个会骗走自己母亲最后一美元的男人。该词已成为一个时尚词，指的是任何为了说服或赢得他人同情而采取的不诚实行为，即使表面上没有任何收获：一个醉汉试图欺骗他所有的朋友，让他们同情他一生中遇到的不幸。

4.135 Cheer
These words refer to the raising of someone’s morale or to the creating of a positive or lively frame of mind. Cheer suggests, most oncretely, that some occurrence has given a boost to an otherwise despondent outlook: We were cheered that the sun had finally come ut and would at least dry our damp, clammy clothing; cheered by news that one helicopter had sighted a feeble fire farther up the ountain slope. Encourage, like cheer, may refer to a raising of morale; as such it implies a resulting frame of mind that is less hopeful than with cheer: encouraged to look back on the considerable distance they had come, but still uneasy about the distance they had yet to cross. In another context, encourage may suggest the awakening of interest in someone else through sympathetic concern: He had been encouraged by his teacher to take his writing seriously.

这些词指提高某人的士气或形成积极或活泼的心境。Cheer 最具体地表明某些事件给原本沮丧的前景带来了提振：我们很高兴，因为太阳终于出来了，至少可以晒干我们潮湿、黏糊糊的衣服；我们也为一架直升机在山坡上发现微弱火势的消息而感到振奋。Encourage 与 cheer 一样，可能指提高士气；因此，它意味着由此产生的心境不如 cheer 那样充满希望：鼓励他们回顾已经走过的很长一段路，但仍然对尚未跨越的距离感到不安。在另一种语境中，encourage 可能暗示通过同情关怀唤醒对他人的兴趣：他的老师鼓励他认真对待写作。

Gladden may suggest the same situation as cheer, but like encourage it can function in its own context, without reference to the raising of a flagging morale: gladdened by their success at building a fire big enough to be seen a good distance off; gladdened by the news that he had become the grandfather of twins. Gladden can sometimes, however, sound faintly outdated or a shade too formal when compared with cheer and especially with encourage. Warm may refer to a revival of morale or to a simple intensity of emotion, deeper than that implied by cheer or gladden: warmed by the ease with which they had cleaned up what had seemed the hopeless mess before them; warmed to know that her savings would go towards seeing her nephew through university.

Gladden 可能与 cheer 所指的情况相同，但与鼓励一样，它可以在自己的语境中发挥作用，而不指提振低落的士气：为他们成功地生起一个大到在很远的地方都能看到的火而感到高兴；为自己成为双胞胎的祖父而感到高兴。然而，与 cheer 尤其是与鼓励相比，Gladden 有时听起来有点过时或太正式了。Warm 可能指士气的复苏或简单的强烈情感，比 cheer 或 gladden 所暗示的更深：为他们轻松地收拾了看似无望的烂摊子而感到温暖；为知道她的积蓄将用于供她的侄子读大学而感到温暖。

Exhilarate is unique among these words in suggesting a situation in which one is filled with a bracing exuberance and zest: He felt listless until the sea breeze exhilarated him and steadied his nerves.

Exhilarate 在这些词语中独一无二，它描述了一种人心中充满着令人振奋的兴奋和热情的情形：他感到无精打采，直到海风让他兴奋起来，稳定了他的情绪。

4.136 Cheerful
These words refer to positive frames of mind or to a brightly optimistic disposition. Cheerful suggests an extroverted and open manner that is warm, pleasant and contented: She smiled back at the cheerful faces of her students; the cheerful holidaymakers at the seaside. Cheery, by contrast, can suggest a cheerful manner that is forced or intrusive in its attempts to make others feel better. The cheery nurse in the hospital who proved to be such a grating nuisance. The word can sometimes be less unpleasant in tone: giving me a cheery wink as I passed by.

这些词指的是积极的心态或乐观的性格。Cheerful 表示一种外向、开放的态度，温暖、愉快和满足：她对着学生们的笑脸和海边快乐的度假者回以微笑。相反，Cheery 可以表示一种开朗的态度，这种态度是强迫的或侵扰性的，目的是让别人感觉更好。医院里那个开朗的护士真是令人讨厌。这个词有时语气不那么令人不快：当我经过时，她朝我眨了眨眼睛。

Happy suggests an inward state of contentment that does not necessarily show itself in any outward bustle such as cheerful or cheery may indicate: so happy at the news that tears gathered in her eyes and ran down her cheeks. Sunny refers particularly to an untroubled disposition that is warm and friendly: a sunny laughter that rang out from the kitchen; the sunny expressions of children at a circus.

Happy 表示内心的满足，不一定表现在外在的忙碌中，例如 cheery 或 cheery 可能表示的：听到这个消息她非常高兴，眼泪都快流出来了。Sunny 特别指一种温暖友好的无忧无虑的性格：从厨房里传出的阳光般的笑声；马戏团里孩子们阳光般的表情。

Bot blithe and winsome suggest a light lack of seriousness in manner. Blithe particularly indicates an almost reckless insouciance or indomitable light-headedness: a blithe way of stuffing unpaid bills in a drawer, as though that would take care of them; a blithe willingness to try anything on impulse. Winsome contrasts with blithe by suggesting an almost staid sweetness or delicacy of manner, warm but subdued; it is most often applied to women: a winsome smile that in the next minute turned into an embarrassed blush.

Bot blithe 和 winsome 都表示举止上略微缺乏严肃性。Blithe 特别表示一种近乎鲁莽的漫不经心或顽固的轻浮：一种将未付账单塞进抽屉的漫不经心方式，好像这样就能解决它们；一种冲动下愿意尝试任何事情的漫不经心。Winsome 与 blithe 形成对比，它表示一种近乎稳重的甜美或优雅的举止，温暖而柔和；它最常用于女性：迷人的微笑在下一分钟变成了尴尬的脸红。

4.137 Child
These words all refer to young human beings who are not yet dults. Child is the most inclusive word and has a wide, general application: when he was a child of three; trying to explain the meaning of death to a child; the delighted cries of children playing in the surf. A child usually ranges in age from that of a small baby to a boy or girl entering puberty. Occasionally adults speak of adolescents as children: high-school children. Child also means an offspring or descendant of any age. [Most young men want to marry and raise children; Captain James Cook was the child of a Yorkshire farm labourer; The Jews are sometimes called the Children of Israel.]

这些词都指尚未成年的年轻人。孩子是最具包容性的词，具有广泛的一般用途：当他还是三岁孩子时；试图向孩子解释死亡的意义；孩子们在海浪中嬉戏时发出的欢呼声。孩子的年龄通常从婴儿到进入青春期的男孩或女孩不等。有时成年人也会将青少年称为孩子：高中生。孩子也指任何年龄的后代或后裔。[大多数年轻人都想结婚生子；詹姆斯·库克船长是约克郡农场工人的孩子；犹太人有时被称为以色列人。]

Baby and infant both designate a newborn or very young child who is still in arms. Baby is the everyday word, while infant tends to sound impersonal or medical. Baby has a more personal quality about it, and is richly connotative of endearment and affection. One would say that a woman is about to give birth to a baby or to a child, but it would sound stilted if she were said to be about to bear an infant. Baby is also the ore general term, being used of the last born of two or more brothers or sisters or of the youngest member of a group: the baby of a large family; the baby of the graduating class. In civil law, an infant is a person who has not yet attained the age of legal majority, usually 21.

婴儿和幼儿都指新生儿或仍在怀里的幼童。婴儿是日常用语，而幼儿听起来往往不近人情或与医学有关。婴儿更具有人情味，富有爱慕和感情的内涵。人们会说一个女人即将生下一个婴儿或一个孩子，但如果说她即将生下一个婴儿，听起来又不自然。婴儿也是最通用的术语，用于指两个或多个兄弟姐妹中最小的孩子或一个群体中最年轻的成员：大家庭中的婴儿；毕业班的婴儿。在民法中，幼儿是指尚未达到法定成年年龄（通常为 21 岁）的人。

A toddler is a child between about the ages of one and two years, who is just emerging from infancy or babyhood. Toddler is a pleasant, homely word, vividly suggesting the short, unsteady steps taken by a child of this age in learning to walk.

幼儿是指刚从婴儿期或婴儿期走出来的 1 至 2 岁左右的儿童。幼儿是一个愉快而亲切的词，生动地描述了这个年龄段的孩子在学习走路时迈出的短小、不稳的步伐。

Little boy and little girl are applied to young children generally between the ages of two and six when they are no longer babies but still regard their parents, rather than other children, as the centre of their world. Because son and daughter have become rather ormal ?some even old-fashioned ?little boy or girl have probably become the commonest words parents use, especially in speech, to refer to children of this age. The little does not mean small; small boy and small girl refer to size, whereas little boy and little girl refer to age, and must now be considered compounds with distinct meanings and connotations not conveyed by the parts of which they are composed.

小男孩和小女孩通常用于描述年龄在 2 至 6 岁之间的幼儿，此时他们已不再是婴儿，但仍将父母而非其他孩子视为世界的中心。由于儿子和女儿已经变得相当常见（有些甚至过时），小男孩或小女孩可能已成为父母最常用的词，尤其是在口语中，用来指代这个年龄段的孩子。小并不意味着小；小男孩和小女孩指尺寸，而小男孩和小女孩指年龄，现在必须将它们视为具有独特含义和内涵的复合词，而这些含义和内涵并非由其组成词的部分传达。

Pre-schooler, a fairly recent term, is applied to a child between the ages of two and five years who is too young to enter a lower primary school but who may be attending a nursery school or kindergarten. Pre-schooler is often used in contradistinction to "school-age child" and has the ring of pedagogic jargon.

学龄前儿童是一个较新的术语，指的是年龄在 2 岁至 5 岁之间、还不能进入小学低年级但可以进入托儿所或幼儿园的儿童。学龄前儿童通常与“学龄儿童”相对照，具有教育术语的意味。

Youngster may refer to a child or adolescent of any age. It is used mainly by older people, and it carries a suggestion of the liveliness and vigour of youth rather than its helplessness or dependency. Hence,it is applied more frequently to a boy than a girl.

Youngster 可以指任何年龄的儿童或青少年。它主要由老年人使用，它带有年轻人的活力和朝气，而不是无助或依赖。因此，它更多地用于指男孩而不是女孩。


4.138 Childish
These words refer to behaviour unbecoming to an adult. Childish suggests lack of control or restraint and carries possible connotations of petulance, irrationality, impatience and self-preoccupation: a childish insistence that everyone listen to him; a childish fear of the dark. The word is so negative in tone that it is seldom now used to describe a young person, or even his understandable limitations. Childlike is also not used to describe the young, since it would be obviously tautological. Used of adults, however, it gives a tone in strong contrast to childish. It suggests having the freshness, curiosity or honesty of the young; it gives possible connotations of innocence, lack of inhibition, zest or eagerness: a childlike ability to look at paintings unhampered by preconceptions; He felt an almost childlike wonder at the beauty of the forest. In uses where it is least positive, it still suggests a touching lack of experience or sham: her childlike naïveté in agreeing to go to his hotel room for a nightcap; a childlike unconcern for the rank and title of his assembled guests.

这些词指的是与成人不相称的行为。幼稚暗示缺乏控制或约束，可能含有任性、无理、不耐烦和以自我为中心等含义：孩子气地坚持要每个人都听他的话；孩子气地害怕黑暗。这个词的语气非常消极，现在很少用来形容年轻人，甚至形容年轻人可以理解的局限性。childlike 也不用于形容年轻人，因为这显然是同义反复。然而，用于成人时，它的语气与 childish 形成鲜明对比。它暗示拥有年轻人的新鲜、好奇或诚实；它可能含有天真、无拘无束、热情或热切等含义：像孩子一样能够不受先入之见的束缚地看画；他对森林的美丽感到一种近乎孩子般的惊奇。在其最不积极的用法中，它仍然暗示着一种感人的缺乏经验或虚伪：她像孩子一样天真地同意去他的酒店房间喝睡前酒；像孩子一样对他所聚集的客人的地位和头衔漠不关心。

Unlike the foregoing, immature and juvenile may be used in factual reference to the young or things pertaining to them: an immature seedling; a juvenile court. In this case, immature is more general since it can refer to any living thing not fully developed, whereas juvenile
refers specifically to young human beings. In reference to adults, both words are disapproving in tone, juvenile somewhat less and immature considerably less than childish. [I suppose we are all a little immature, but while I have been guilty of juvenile behaviour from time to time, he is downright childish.] Juvenile indicates behaviour typical of a young person nearing adulthood, and thus may suggest intemperance, extremism, laziness, excessive zeal or idealism, or thoughtless inconsiderateness: a juvenile inability to compromise; a juvenile habit of seeing everything in black and white; juvenile snap judgements. In recent usage, immature has become a fad word for any failing in rationality or lack of understanding in group relations. As such it would be inclusive of behaviour suggested by childish or juvenile, except that overuse has made it milder sounding, since almost any failing can be considered immature: an immature wish to be divorced at the first sign of friction; an immature dependence on others for his opinions. Also, the word might specifically refer to behaviour that falls short of that appropriate to a person’s chronological age: immature of him to go off courting as though he were still a young man.

与上述情况不同，不成熟和少年可以用于指代年轻人或与他们有关的事物：未成熟的幼苗；少年法庭。在这种情况下，不成熟更为普遍，因为它可以指代任何尚未完全发育的生物，而少年则专指年轻人。在指代成年人时，这两个词的语气都带有不赞同的意味，少年的语气稍轻，不成熟则轻得多。[我想我们都有些不成熟，但尽管我偶尔会犯少年行为的错误，但他完全是幼稚的。]少年表示接近成年的年轻人的典型行为，因此可能暗示放纵、极端主义、懒惰、过度热情或理想主义，或轻率、不体谅：少年无法妥协；少年习惯于非黑即白地看待一切；少年草率判断。近来，“不成熟”一词已成为一种流行词，用来形容任何缺乏理性或对群体关系缺乏理解的行为。因此，这个词涵盖了幼稚或幼稚的行为，只是过度使用使其听起来更温和，因为几乎任何缺陷都可以被视为不成熟：一出现摩擦迹象就想离婚的不成熟想法；不成熟地依赖他人的意见。此外，这个词可能专门指不符合一个人实际年龄的行为：他像个年轻人一样去求爱，这是不成熟的。

Infantile and puerile are the most disapproving of all these words. From their construction, both might be thought capable of neutral description, but puerile is almost never used in this way, and infantile only when used as a technical word; even in such contexts infant is often preferred: infantile paralysis; infantile (or infant) behaviour. Similarly one would refer to a boy boyhood (not puerile) dreams. Infantile, when applied to other than infants, is in fact an intensification of childish and suggests complete self-absorption and helplessness: his wife’s infantile tantrums. The most formal of these words, puerile is also more vague in its condemnation. It can suggest anything callow, weak, stupid, or inept. At its most vague, it can mean simply worthless:puerile efforts to negotiate; the pianist’s puerile performance.

在所有词语中，幼稚和幼稚是最令人反感的。从构造上看，这两个词都可以用作中性描述，但幼稚几乎从未被这样使用，幼稚只在用作专业术语时才被使用；即使在这样的语境中，也常常倾向于使用婴儿：婴儿麻痹；幼稚（或婴儿）行为。同样，人们会提到男孩童年（而非幼稚）的梦想。幼稚用于婴儿以外的其他事物时，实际上是孩子气的强化，暗示着完全的自我陶醉和无助：他妻子的幼稚脾气。幼稚是这些词语中最正式的，其谴责性也更模糊。它可以暗示任何幼稚、软弱、愚蠢或无能的事物。在最模糊的情况下，它可以简单地表示毫无价值：幼稚的谈判努力；钢琴家幼稚的表演。

4.139 Choose
Choose, pick and select mean to take one or more from a number of things available ?usually a matter of preference. They may be used as exact synonyms: a man buying a lawn mower chooses (or
picks or selects) the one best suited to his needs. However, these words have separate shades of meaning that may make one or another of them more appropriate in a particular context. In the word choose,for example, the emphasis is on the act of will exercised in making the decision and, sometimes, on the finality of the decision. When we say that a young man chooses a career, we imply that he is making a voluntary decision and that he will probably pursue that career for the best of his working life. To select is to choose from several things (we choose, rather than select, one of two alternatives), and it suggests discrimination and a careful weighing of the reasons for the choice: At the beginning of the trial, a great deal of time was spent selecting the jurors. Pick is less precise in meaning than the other two words and can be used to cover situations in which neither decision-making nor discrimination is required: A housewife in a supermarket, confronted by several tins of tomatoes of identical size and quality, will often pick he one nearest to her.	

选择、挑选和挑选的意思是，从许多可用的东西中挑选一件或多件——通常是个人喜好问题。它们可以用作同义词：购买割草机的人选择（或挑选或挑选）最适合自己需要的那件。然而，这些词有不同的含义，可能使它们中的某一个在特定语境中更合适。例如，在选择这个词中，强调的是做决定时所运用的意志行为，有时也强调决定的最终性。当我们说一个年轻人选择了一份职业时，我们暗示他是在自愿做决定，而且他可能会把这份职业作为他职业生涯中最好的选择。选择是从几件事情中挑选（我们选择而不是挑选两个选项中的一个），它表明了对选择理由的辨别和仔细权衡：在审判开始时，花了大量时间来挑选陪审员。 Pick 的含义不如其他两个词精确，可以用来描述不需要决策或辨别的情况：超市里的家庭主妇，面对几罐大小和质量完全相同的西红柿，通常会挑选离她最近的一罐。

Elect usually connotes choosing from a limited number of alternatives. In its usual sense, it means to choose a person for office by a majority or plurality of votes. [The high-school class elected him captain; The American people elect a president every four years.]

选举通常意味着从有限数量的备选方案中进行选择。通常意义上，它意味着通过多数票或多数票选出一个人担任公职。[高中生选举他为队长；美国人民每四年选举一位总统。]

Cull means to pick the good from the bad or, more precisely, the bad rom the good: A sheep breeder culls the weak animals from his flock.

剔除 (Cull) 的意思是挑选好的从坏的，或者更准确地说，从好的中挑选坏的： 一位养羊人从他的羊群中剔除弱小的动物。

4.140 Circumlocution
These words indicate a roundabout way of expressing ideas or of referring to something. Circumlocution, derived from Latin roots that mean speaking around, is quite formal. Periphrasis, derived from omparable Greek roots, is even more formal and more technical in tone. Both pertain to the substitution of lengthy phraseology for more simple expressions: the circumlocutions of a candidate who wished to win friends on both sides of every issue; judicial rulings that are clogged with periphrasis, peppered with whereases, and nderstandable by no one. Circumlocution, being slightly more common, has gathered more connotations to it; the word can suggest the avoidance of direct statement out of squeamishness, insincerity, self-interest or a misplaced desire for elegance: the emphasis of iplomatic protocol on its own strange set of polite circumlocutions. Periphrasis, by contrast, is more restricted to a grammatical context and is perhaps more neutral in simply indicating the choice of a longer rather than a shorter expression of comparable function. "In order to" is sometimes a needless periphrasis for "to".
	
这些词表示一种迂回的表达想法或提及某事的方式。Circumlocution 源自拉丁语词根，意为拐弯抹角，非常正式。Periphrasis 源自类似的希腊语词根，语气更加正式，技术性更强。这两个词都指用冗长的措辞代替简单的表达：希望在每个问题上都赢得双方朋友的候选人的迂回言论；充斥着迂回和反驳并且无人理解的司法裁决。Circumlocution 更为常见，因此具有更多的内涵；这个词可以表示出于胆怯、不真诚、自私或对优雅的错误追求而避免直接陈述：国际礼仪强调其自己一套奇怪的礼貌迂回言论。相比之下，迂回句更受语法语境的限制，可能更中性，因为它只是表示选择较长的表达方式而不是较短的表达方式，但功能相当。“为了”有时是“为了”的不必要的迂回句。

Indirectness, of course, is a much less formal, much more general, and much clearer synonym for the previous pair of words. It refers to the avoidance of simply or forceful expressions for whatever reason: an indirectness of style that stems from his reliance on the passive voice
and his constant reference to himself as "one." By contrast, euphuism is highly specific. This word comes from the name of a literary character, Euphues, subject of two Elizabethan works of fiction by John Lyly. It refers to a ridiculous straining after an elegant prose style by clothing a paucity of thought in orotund parallelisms, flowery similes and other verbal frills.

当然，间接性是前两个词的同义词，其形式要简单得多，更为通用，也更为清晰。它指的是出于任何原因而避免简单或有力的表达：一种间接的风格，源于他对被动语态的依赖
以及他经常将自己称为“一个人”。相比之下，委婉语则非常具体。这个词来自文学人物的名字，Euphues，是约翰·利利两部伊丽莎白时代小说的主题。它指的是一种荒谬的追求优雅散文风格的努力，用华丽的平行句、华丽的明喻和其他语言装饰来掩盖思想的匮乏。

Euphemism, sometimes confused with euphuism, comes from Greek roots meaning to speak well. It refers to a specific tendency in speech or writing which involves the substituting of a mild, inexact or technical-sounding term for a more forceful, clear or blunt term when the latter is thought capable of giving offence. Euphemisms are commonly substituted for words pertaining to parts of the body, death, sex and bodily functions. "Limb" was a Victorian euphemism for "leg." Some use the euphemism "pass away" instead of saying "die." "The departed" is often used as a euphemism for "the dead."

委婉语有时与 euphuism 混淆，它源于希腊语，意为说得好。它指的是口语或写作中的一种特定倾向，即当后者被认为可能引起冒犯时，用更强烈、更清晰或更直白的词语代替温和、不准确或听起来更专业的词语。委婉语通常用于代替与身体部位、死亡、性和身体功能有关的词语。“Limb”是维多利亚时代“leg”的委婉说法。有些人使用委婉语“pass away”来代替“die”。“The died”通常用作“the dead”的委婉说法。

4.141 Circumscribe
These words refer to something that lies on all or many sides of something else. Circumscribe is the most formal of these words but the most precise in reference, specifically indicating the drawing of a line round a plane figure so as to touch as many points of the figure as possible: a square circumscribed by a circle. Used to describe geographical situations, it need not adhere to this strict geometrical definition, but it still suggests something hedged in on all sides: a small country completely circumscribed by mountains. In other uses, the point of the word is an emphasis on the restriction of something within set limits: severely circumscribing the freedom to dissent in time of war. Encompass means to take in or embrace. Like circumscribe, it may refer to a line drawn round a figure, but it more particularly indicates something set within a circle. It may, furthermore, suggest a setting of limits, but it more often implies a measuring of natural capacities: a view that encompassed the whole of the valley; a mind that could encompass only a few obvious truths: an erudition that encompassed amazing expanses of abstruse knowledge.

这些词指位于其他事物四面或多面的事物。Circumscribe 是这些词中最正式的，但指代也最精确，具体指代在平面图形周围画一条线，以接触图形上尽可能多的点：圆外接的正方形。用来描述地理情况时，它不必遵循这种严格的几何定义，但仍指四面都被围起来的事物：完全被群山环绕的小国。在其他用法中，这个词的重点是强调将某物限制在设定的范围内：在战争时期严格限制异议自由。Encompass 意味着接纳或包含。与 circumscribe 一样，它可能指围绕图形画的线，但它更具体地表示圆圈内的某物。此外，它可能暗示设定限制，但更多时候意味着测量自然能力：涵盖整个山谷的景色；心智只能包含少数显而易见的真理，而学识却包含令人惊叹的深奥知识。

Bound almost exclusively pertains to the setting of limits found in circumscribe. It may not, however, necessarily suggest a total hedging in on all sides by the same medium: a city accessible to motorists from the north, although bounded on the south and east by jungle, and on the west by desert. Surround, by contrast, suggests something hedged in on all sides by the same thing, and thus it might be thought a more informal substitute for circumscribe. Surround, however, very often emphasizes an undesirable, hostile, or dangerous circumscribing: a cabin surrounded by the wilderness; decimated troops surrounded by the enemy; watching the dingoes surround the injured ewe. The word can, of course, be used without negative implications: surrounded by the smiling faces of his friends. Encircle is closest to surround in its generality, but it does specifically suggest a tighter cluster about a central object and most often indicates a deliberate grouping for a definite reason: Oppressed serfs throughout the surrounding ountryside joined together to encircle the castle.

Bound 几乎只适用于 circumscribe 中的限制设置。但是，它可能不一定表示四面都被同一种媒介完全包围：一个城市，驾车者可以从北边进入，尽管南边和东边被丛林包围，西边被沙漠包围。相比之下，Surround 表示四面都被同一种东西包围，因此它可能被认为是 circumscribe 的更不正式的替代词。但是，Surround 经常强调一种不受欢迎、充满敌意或危险的包围：被荒野包围的小屋；被敌人包围的被消灭的部队；看着野狗围着受伤的母羊。当然，这个词可以不带负面含义地使用：被朋友的笑脸包围。Encircle 在一般意义上最接近于 around，但它确实特别表示围绕中心物体的更紧密的聚集，并且通常表示出于明确原因而故意聚集：整个周围乡村被压迫的农奴联合起来包围城堡。

While the previous words suggest, in simplest terms, a two-dimensional encircling, the remaining words all may indicate a three-dimensional gathering of one thing about another. Envelop refers most strictly to such a situation. It suggests the total surrounding of something, especially by folds or layers, so as to cover up or obscure the thing within: a porcelain vase enveloped in cotton; an aircraft enveloped in fog; He enveloped her in the folds of his cloak. In more metaphorical use, it may refer to a pervasive atmosphere or a totally preoccupied state of mind: enveloped by a sense of warm, sleepy contentment. It may also have overtones of protectiveness or secrecy: the overdone love with which she enveloped her son; an episode enveloped in mystery. Enclose is similar to envelop except that the latter often suggests an amorphous material in which something else may become lost or blurred, whereas enclose may suggest a hollowed solid or anything especially designed to fit round something else: a clock enclosed by a glass bell. Enclose suggests specifically a difficulty of access and often carries overtones of imprisonment or protectiveness: radio-active substances enclosed in heavy lead containers; housewives enclosed in a world of drab routine; a sleeping child enclosed in its mother’s arms. Contain may refer to the mere presence of one thing inside another: plants that contain potassium; the safe that contained the jewels. But it may more specifically suggest the resistance of the thing contained: measures that might contain the vandalism of the students. It has also become a recent fad word in the terminology of power politics: the deployment of missile bases to contain the aggressor.

前面几个词语用最简单的术语表示二维的包围，而其余的词语 all 则可能表示一件事物在另一件事物周围的三维聚集。Envelop 最严格地指这种情况。它表示将某物完全包围，尤其是通过折叠或分层，以掩盖或遮挡其中的东西：被棉花包裹的瓷花瓶；被雾包裹的飞机；他用斗篷的褶皱将她包裹起来。在更具隐喻性的用法中，它可能指一种普遍的氛围或一种全神贯注的精神状态：被一种温暖、困倦的满足感所包围。它也可能具有保护或保密的含义：她对儿子过度的爱；一段被神秘所笼罩的插曲。Enclose 与 envelop 相似，不同之处在于后者通常表示一种无定形材料，其中其他东西可能会丢失或模糊，而 enclose 可能表示空心固体或任何特别设计用来包裹其他东西的东西：被玻璃钟罩住的钟。封闭特别指难以接近，并且经常带有监禁或保护的含义：放射性物质被封闭在沉重的铅容器中；家庭主妇被封闭在单调乏味的日常生活中；熟睡的孩子被母亲的怀抱所包围。遏制可能指一件事物存在于另一件事中：含有钾的植物；装有珠宝的保险箱。但它可能更具体地暗示被遏制事物的抵抗：可能遏制学生破坏行为的措施。它也成为强权政治术语中最近的流行词：部署导弹基地来遏制侵略者。

4.142 Cite

These words are concerned with the presentation of supporting evidence in discussion, analysis or argument. Cite is a highly specific word, precisely directed to this concept. To cite an example is to bring it forward as proof or illustration of a point. Cite almost always suggests a backing up of assertions by authoritative investigation or knowledge, rather than a mere hazarding of guesses. In particular, cite often implies a collection or repository of sources or examples that any other investigator could easily go to for corroboration: The bibliography cited more than a hundred source books that the author had consulted. Cite may also suggest that a complete and detailed presentation of an argument is being given: to cite the reasons behind President Roosevelt’s abstention from war prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.

这些词与讨论、分析或争论中支持性证据的呈现有关。Cite 是一个非常具体的词，正是针对这个概念。引用一个例子就是把它作为观点的证明或说明。Cite 几乎总是暗示通过权威调查或知识来支持断言，而不仅仅是猜测。特别是，cite 通常意味着收集或储存任何其他调查者可以轻易寻求佐证的资料来源或例子：书目引用了作者查阅过的 100 多本资料书籍。Cite 也可能暗示正在完整而详细地陈述一个论点：引用罗斯福总统在日本袭击珍珠港之前弃战的原因。

Of all these words, refer is the definite in suggesting how much or how little corroborating evidence will be presented. A treatise might merely refer to well-known facts in passing, on the assumption that they will be familiar to everyone. On the other hand, especially in verbal discussions, refer may imply the looking up of authoritative information about the point in question: to refer to the dictionary; turning to the Bible in order to refer to the exact wording of a disputed quotation.

在所有这些词中，refer 明确地表明了将提供多少确凿的证据。一篇论文可能只是顺便提及众所周知的事实，假设每个人都熟悉这些事实。另一方面，特别是在口头讨论中，refer 可能意味着查找有关所讨论观点的权威信息：查阅字典；查阅圣经以查找有争议的引文的确切措辞。

Adduce means to bring forward for proof or consideration, and may refer to an example, argument or item of evidence. It suggests a succinct listing of the details that support a case, although each detail might be sketched rather than developed in full: adducing reasons why the United States should have entered the war in 1939. One might refer to definitive proof that the world is round, but one would have to be more specific in order to adduce the reasons why this is known to be true. In other instances, adduce may be closely synonymous with the other words in this set; but it is much more formal and may seem unduly erudite or stuffy in tone.

Adduce 的意思是提出证据或考虑，可以指一个例子、论点或证据。它建议简洁地列出支持案件的细节，尽管每个细节可能只是概述而不是完整阐述：提出美国应该在 1939 年参战的原因。人们可能会提到地球是圆的确凿证据，但为了提出为什么这是事实的理由，人们必须更具体。在其他情况下，adduce 可能与这组中的其他词密切同义；但它更加正式，可能显得过于博学或语气沉闷。

Quote refers to an exact, word-for-word citation of one’s sources. If one cites another person’s arguments, one may be paraphrasing them. But if one claims to be quoting those arguments, then one is responsible for reproducing them exactly as they appear in the source. [The Prime Minister had typescripts of his speech handed out, since he was all too familiar with the inability of journalists to quote his remarks accurately.]

引用是指对资料来源逐字逐句的准确引用。如果一个人引用了另一个人的论点，那么他可能是在解释这些论点。但是，如果一个人声称自己引用了这些论点，那么他有责任准确地按照资料来源中的内容重现它​​们。[首相将他的演讲稿分发出去，因为他非常清楚记者无法准确引用他的言论。]

4.143 City
All these words denote a geographically or politically defined area and the population it contains. Here they are considered only as general terms and not as specific local-government definitions (where applicable), since the hierarchical organization of local government varies from state to state in Australia and differs again in New Zealand. A city is a municipality (in New Zealand a borough) with definite boundaries and with various legal powers derived from a charter granted by the government. To be declared a city, a municipality (borough) must attain a prescribed population figure (e.g., 15,000 in South Australia, 20,000 in New Zealand) and yield a certain annual revenue in rates. Hamlet and village, which are thought of as the smallest clusters of settlement in the list, are both collections of buildings in a rural district. Neither word is in common parlance nowadays, but both are often used in writing: a quaint old English hamlet with its thatched cottages and cobbled street; a picturesque village in the Italian Alps. (Occasionally there is a departure from the rural context, as in Melbourne’s fashionable inner residential area of Toorak, in which the shopping centre and immediate vicinity is known s Toorak Village.)

所有这些词都表示地理或政治上定义的区域及其人口。在这里，它们仅被视为一般术语，而不是特定的地方政府定义（如适用），因为地方政府的层级组织在澳大利亚各州各不相同，在新西兰也有所不同。城市是一个有明确边界的市政当局（在新西兰是自治市镇），并拥有政府授予的宪章赋予的各种法律权力。要被宣布为城市，市政当局（自治市镇）必须达到规定的人口数量（例如，南澳大利亚州为 15,000 人，新西兰为 20,000 人）并产生一定的年税收收入。Hamlet 和 village 被认为是列表中最小的聚居地，都是农村地区的建筑群。这两个词现在都不常用，但都经常用于书面语：一个古雅的英国小村庄，有茅草屋和鹅卵石街道；意大利阿尔卑斯山的一个风景如画的村庄。 （有时会脱离乡村背景，比如墨尔本时尚的图拉克内城区住宅区，这里的购物中心和附近地区被称为图拉克村。）

A town is an area with a more considerable collection of buildings than a hamlet or a village, and with a population of some hundreds or thousands. The word is generally used in reference to rural regions: a city businessman who had been born and reared in a country town. When towns and small cities are primarily residential areas adjacent to a large city, or are actually close to its heart (as the City of Subiaco in Perth), they are known as suburbs. The kind of central city around which suburban communities spring up is often referred to as a metropolis; Sydney and Mebourne, for instance, may be described in this way. In Australia, the six state capital cities and Canberra, capital city of the Australian Capital Territory, are known as metropolitan areas.

镇是建筑物比村庄或村落多，人口数百或数千的区域。该词通常用于指农村地区：出生和成长在乡镇的城市商人。如果镇和小城市主要是大城市附近的住宅区，或者实际上靠近大城市的中心（如珀斯的苏比亚科市），则被称为郊区。郊区社区在其周围兴起的中心城市通常被称为大都市；例如，悉尼和墨尔本可以这样描述。在澳大利亚，六个州首府城市和澳大利亚首都领地的首府堪培拉被称为大都市区。

Megalopolis ?not to be confused with metropolis because of sound and spelling ?is a word that may be encountered as a result of its growing currency in the United States. There it describes an urban complex made up of several major cities. Such a complex is that bounded by Boston on the north and Washington on the south, with New York as its centre. Australian urban planners are familiar with the term, and some think of the Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong complex as a megalopolis. The word is a Greek one meaning great city. The Greek megalopolis was a large city with a population made up of people who moved there from surrounding villages.

大都市（不要因为发音和拼写而与大都市混淆）这个词在美国越来越流行。在美国，它描述的是由几个大城市组成的城市综合体。这样的城市综合体北以波士顿为界，南以华盛顿为界，以纽约为中心。澳大利亚的城市规划师对这个词很熟悉，有些人认为纽卡斯尔-悉尼-伍伦贡综合体就是大都市。这个词源于希腊语，意为大城市。希腊语中的大都市是指人口由周边村庄迁入的大城市。


4.144 Claim
These words are concerned with establishing ownership or possession of land, money or other valuables. A claim may be an actual document that permits one to possess land formerly in the public domain ?or it may be the land itself: a claim of only a few acres that seemed worthless until gold was discovered near by. In a more general sense, a claim may be an assertion of one’s legal or moral entitlement to something that is held, withheld or owed to one by another: the drama coach who made a claim on the estate of the deceased actress; the Negro’s claim to full equality; an injured workman’s claim to compensation. Title, like claim, may also refer to an actual documentthat gives one possession of land or real estate. But unlike a claim that one may earn or come to possess by following a certain set of procedures, a title cannot usually be had except by purchase or inheritance. [The prospector staked, then filed, his claim; Her uncle’s will gave her title to the house.]

这些词与确立对土地、金钱或其他贵重物品的所有权或占有权有关。所有权可以是一份实际文件，允许某人占有以前属于公共领域的土地 - 或者可以是土地本身：只有几英亩的土地所有权，在附近发现黄金之前，这些土地似乎毫无价值。从更一般的意义上讲，所有权可以是某人对某人持有、扣留或欠下的东西的法律或道德权利的主张：戏剧教练对已故女演员的遗产提出所有权；黑人要求获得完全平等；受伤工人要求获得赔偿。所有权，就像所有权一样，也可以指一份实际文件，赋予某人土地或不动产的所有权。但与可以通过遵循某些程序获得或拥有的所有权不同，所有权通常只能通过购买或继承获得。[勘探者提出并提交了他的所有权；她叔叔的遗嘱赋予了她对房子的所有权。]

A perquisite, colloquially a "perk," is now more often called a "fringe benefit." In any case, it is something that accrues to one as an added advantage of one’s usual job or position: perquisites that included free room and board. It may suggest a monetary consideration in the form of a tip or bonus; and it may be specified in writing or may be simply an unwritten understanding between employer and employee.

津贴，俗称“额外津贴”，现在更常被称为“附加福利”。无论如何，它都是一个人在通常的工作或职位之外获得的额外福利：包括免费食宿在内的津贴。它可能以小费或奖金的形式暗示金钱报酬；它可能以书面形式规定，也可能只是雇主和雇员之间的非书面谅解。

A right is the most general of these terms and might substitute for any of them. In its narrowest sense, it may imply a legal proof of ownership, or a contractual agreement that has been put into writing. In is larger sense, it may refer to those things to which someone feels entitled without actually possessing them; such a right may be a moral, ethical, emotional or tactical one: a right to ten per cent of all proceeds from the book’s sales; a child’s right to love and understanding; the inalienable right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

权利是这些术语中最通用的，可以替代任何术语。从最狭义上讲，权利可能意味着所有权的合法证明，或已成文的合同协议。从更广泛的意义上讲，权利可能指某人认为自己有权获得但实际上并未拥有的东西；这种权利可能是道德、伦理、情感或策略方面的权利：获得图书销售全部收益的 10% 的权利；儿童获得爱和理解的权利；不可剥夺的生存、自由和追求幸福的权利。

4.145 Clarify
These words refer to attempts at removing confusion or making something understandable. Clarify usually pertains to words or actions intended to make clear an earlier event, situation, announcement or state of affairs: a statement isused to clarify his seemingly contradictory views on the proposed merger; contradictory answers that he made no attempt to clarify; adding details to the sketch that would clarify the spatial relationships; a plot structure that needed clarifying. Elucidate is a more formal substitute for clarify. While the root of clarify refers literally to clearness, the root of elucidate refers to light. To elucidate something is to throw light on it. The word’s use reflects this in indicating any enlightening process that puts an end to confusion: searching for the clues that would elucidate the mystery; psychological theories drawn up to elucidate human behaviour. Thus elucidate in its very formality has a wider range of application than clarify. Explicate is more restricted and specific in use than the foregoing. It refers to a point-by-point discussion of a complex matter, especially as in the paraphrase and analysis of a literary text: asking each student to explicate the difficult poem; popular books that attempt to explicate Einstein’s theories.

这些词指试图消除困惑或使某事变得可以理解。澄清通常指旨在澄清先前事件、情况、公告或事态的词语或行动：用声明来澄清他对拟议合并的看似矛盾的观点；他没有试图澄清的矛盾答案；在草图中添加细节以澄清空间关系；需要澄清的情节结构。阐明是澄清的更正式替代词。虽然澄清的词根字面意思是清晰，但阐明的词根是指光明。阐明某事就是照亮它。这个词的用法反映了这一点，它表示任何能结束困惑的启发过程：寻找能阐明谜团的线索；制定心理学理论来阐明人类行为。因此，阐明在形式上比澄清具有更广泛的应用范围。阐明的用法比前面的更严格和具体。它指的是对复杂问题进行逐点讨论，尤其是对文学文本的解释和分析：要求每个学生解释难懂的诗歌；试图解释爱因斯坦理论的流行书籍。

Explain and interpret are far less formal than the previous words and have wider ranges of use. A person may explain a thing by describing its form or structure, tracing its origins and development, showing its operation or use, or citing its reasons and the relations of its parts. Hence an expert might elucidate one detail of a complex matter without explaining the whole. In its most informal sense, explain suggests a verbal attempt to justify actions or to make them understood: trying to explain why he had stayed out so late. When it is closer in meaning to elucidate, it may suggest a total falling into place of a causal sequence: experiments designed to explain the mechanics of heredity; the discovery of several notes that explained his homicidal behaviour. Interpret is like explicate in suggesting a point-by-point treatment of an earlier situation, pronouncement or event so that it can be understood; it is like elucidate in implying the use of knowledge or insight to cast light on some baffling problem or puzzle, though it differs in stressing personal judgement or understanding: to interpret a symbolic dream; to interpret an obscure piece of writing. In a limited sense, interpret may refer to oral translation from one language to another: A skilled linguist was needed to interpret the statements of the visiting head of state. Less specifically, the word may imply any sort of after-the-fact analysis, in which case it may point to a less exhaustive or technical approach than explicate: a journalist who interpreted economic trends for the layman.

解释和阐释远不如前面两个词正式，但使用范围更广。一个人可以通过描述事物的形式或结构、追溯其起源和发展、说明其操作或用途，或引证其原因和各部分的关系来解释事物。因此，专家可能会阐明复杂问题的一个细节，而无需解释整体。在最不正式的意义上，解释表示试图用言语证明行为的合理性或使人理解：试图解释他为什么在外面呆到这么晚。当它的含义更接近于阐明时，它可能表示完全推翻某个因果关系：旨在解释遗传机制的实验；发现几张可以解释他杀人行为的笔记。解释与阐释类似，都建议逐点处理先前的情况、声明或事件，以便理解；它与阐明类似，都暗示着使用知识或洞察力来解释一些令人困惑的问题或谜题，尽管它在强调个人判断或理解方面有所不同：解释一个象征性的梦；解释一篇晦涩难懂的文章。在有限的意义上，解释可能指从一种语言到另一种语言的口头翻译：需要一位熟练的语言学家来翻译来访国家元首的声明。更具体地说，这个词可能意味着任何形式的事后分析，在这种情况下，它可能指的是一种比解释更不详尽或技术性的方法：一位为外行解释经济趋势的记者。

4.146 Class
These words, as here considered, refer to groupings in, or divisions of, a stratified society. Class is the most general word. It refers primarily to a social division of society, as the middle class; but a lass may also be an economic division, as the working class, a functional division, as the managerial class; or a division embracing persons with other common characteristics, as the educated class. Classes are based on such things as lineage, income and occupation. A caste, by contrast, is a strictly hereditary division of society ?especially one of the four Hindu social classes in India. The highest of these is the Brahman, or priestly, caste. A member of the lowest caste was formerly called an untouchable, his touch having been counted as pollution by Hindus of higher station. A person is able to move from one class to another; but where a rigid caste system is in effect, he cannot escape from his caste.

这里所指的这些词指的是一个分层社会中的群体或划分。阶级是最常用的词。它主要指社会阶层，如中产阶级；但也可以是经济阶层，如工人阶级；职能阶层，如管理阶层；或具有其他共同特征的阶层，如受过教育的阶层。阶级以血统、收入和职业等为基础。相比之下，种姓则是严格世袭的社会阶层——尤其是印度教的四个社会阶层之一。其中最高的是婆罗门种姓，即祭司种姓。最低种姓的成员以前被称为贱民，因为地位较高的印度教徒认为他的接触是污秽。一个人可以从一个阶层转移到另一个阶层；但在严格的种姓制度实行的地方，他无法摆脱自己的种姓。

An estate is a class of people with a distinct political or social status, having in common special duties, privileges, powers or limitations with respect to government. An estate was originally one of the three classes of feudal society in Europe ?the Estates of the Realm being the clergy, the nobility, and the common people. The political power of the press later caused the journalistic fraternity to be dubbed the fourth estate. In a general sense, estate, like class, may be used to indicate rank, position or social standing: a lady of high estate. Class is also applied to thing or services as a measure of quality: first-class as opposed to tourist-class accommodation.

等级是指具有独特政治或社会地位的一类人，他们在政府方面具有共同的特殊职责、特权、权力或限制。等级最初是欧洲封建社会的三个阶级之一——王国的等级包括神职人员、贵族和平民。后来，由于新闻界的政治权力，新闻界被称为第四等级。从一般意义上讲，等级和阶级一样，可用于表示等级、职位或社会地位：高等级的女士。阶级也用于衡量事物或服务的质量：一流而非旅游级住宿。

In one sense, order is close to class in indicating a stratum of society or a cohesive social or professional group: the scorn of the aristocracy for the lower orders. Specifically, order often refers to the rank or position of an ordained Christian clergyman ?a bishop being in the highest order of the ministry, a priest in the second, and a deacon in the third. In traditional angelology, order designates one of the nine grades or choirs of angels, which are, in ascending rank, angels, archangels, rincipalities, powers, virtues, dominations or dominions, thrones, cherubim and seraphim. Order may also refer to an honorary society to which members are named by a sovereign as a mark of the highest distinction: The Order of the Garter is the highest order of knighthood in Britain.

从某种意义上说，秩序与阶级相近，都表示社会阶层或有凝聚力的社会或职业群体：贵族对下层阶级的蔑视。具体来说，秩序通常指受命的基督教牧师的等级或地位——主教是最高级别的牧师，牧师排在第二位，执事排在第三位。在传统的天使学中，秩序指天使的九个等级或合唱团之一，按升序排列，天使、大天使、首领、权力、美德、统治或统治、宝座、基路伯和炽天使。秩序也可能指由君主任命的荣誉团体，作为最高荣誉的标志：嘉德勋章是英国最高的骑士勋章。

4.147 Clean
These words refer to anything that is unsoiled by use or neglect or that is untainted by dirt or grime. Clean emphasizes freedom from dirt, grime or stain. A thing may be clean because it is new, unused or unmarked: a clean sheet of paper. More often, the word suggests that something has been freed of soil or the marks of use in order to be used again: clean dishes, clean sheets. Less concretely, clean can refer to an absence of fault or failing which combines in some uses with its reference to the absence of marks, implying a place where faults might otherwise be marked down in a list: a clean slate; a clean record. The word’s implications of purity further extend to the moral sense, referring to that which is innocent, especially of sexual impropriety: a clean mind; clean jokes. Clean can, however, refer simply to what is well-meaning and harmless: good clean fun.

这些词指任何未因使用或疏忽而变脏，或未受灰尘或尘垢污染的事物。干净强调没有灰尘、尘垢或污点。某物可能是因为是新的、未使用过的或没有标记而干净的：一张干净的纸。更常见的是，这个词表示某物已经没有了污垢或使用痕迹，可以再次使用：干净的盘子、干净的床单。不太具体地说，干净可以指没有缺点或失败，在某些用法中与没有痕迹相结合，暗示在清单上可能会标记缺点的地方：一张干净的石板；一张干净的记录。这个词的纯洁含义进一步延伸到道德意义，指无辜的，尤其是无不当性行为：干净的心灵；干净的笑话。但是，干净可以仅指善意和无害的事物：干净的乐趣。

Fresh is often used in apposition with clean to emphasize newness or lack of use as well as purity: fresh, clean snow; a fresh, clean shirt. It may also suggest something revivifying in its purity: fresh air. Used in reference to failings, it suggests, not an absence of faults, but the putting aside of past mistakes: a fresh start; fresh approaches. Spotless refers to an actual absence of marks or blemishes. It is, however, more emphatic than clean, and carries implications of neatness and tidiness as well: a spotless room. Other wise, the word may simply be a hyperbolic substitute for clean, though it may differ in describing something never sullied: a spotless record.

Fresh 经常与 clean 用作同位语，强调全新或未经使用以及纯净：新鲜干净的雪；干净整洁的衬衫。它也可能指纯净得能让人精神焕发的事物：新鲜空气。用于指缺点时，它并不是指没有缺点，而是指放下过去的错误：一个新的开始；新的方法。Spotless 指确实没有痕迹或瑕疵。但是，它比 clean 更强调，也含有整洁的意思：一尘不染的房间。另一方面，这个词可能只是 clean 的夸张替代词，尽管它在描述从未被玷污的东西时可能有所不同：一尘不染的记录。

Stainless may be used in a way closely resembling spotless. Much more often now, however, it indicates something that cannot be stained, especially something designed with this quality in mind: stainless steel cutlery. In this sense something that is stainless need not necessarily be clean. Immaculate, the most formal of these words, can function like spotless as a hyperbole for clean in all situations: an immaculate suit. On this level, it reflects its Latin root which means literally without spot. But the word also has a wider ranges of application to moral propriety and is particularly relevant in a religious context, meaning sinless: hermits who strove to lead immaculate lives. The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception holds that Jesus was conceived untainted by original sin.

Stainless 的用法与 spotless 很相似。然而，现在它更常表示无法被玷污的东西，尤其是以这种品质设计的物品：不锈钢餐具。从这个意义上说，不锈的东西不一定是干净的。Immaculate 是这些词中最正式的词，在所有情况下都可以像 spotless 一样起到表示干净的夸张作用：一套一尘不染的衣服。在这个层面上，它反映了其拉丁语词根，字面意思是没有污点。但这个词在道德礼仪方面也有更广泛的应用，尤其在宗教背景下，意思是无罪的：努力过上纯洁生活的隐士。圣母无玷始胎的教义认为耶稣在受孕时没有受到原罪的玷污。

4.148 Clean
These words refer to the removing of dirt, disorder or unwanted matter. Clean is the most general of these, referring to any methods whatever by which something is freed of grime, refurbished or made pure: cleaning her nails with a nailfile; cleaning the mud from his boots with a brush; cleaning the cutting board with soap and water; a machine to clean and recirculate the air. Cleanse, when substituted for lean in any of these examples, gives an odd or inappropriately formal tone. In other uses, it may suggest an especially thorough cleaning or immersion in water. At its most specific, it indicates a careful bathing action: cleansing the wound of infected matter. It is also appropriately used metaphorically when clean might be ludicrous or too concrete: cleansing the administration of graft and corruption; the breaking through of sunlight to cleanse the day of its sullen shadows. The word also has special pertinence with reference to the removal of pollution of the washing away of evil or sin: cleansing our rivers of poisonous wastes; cleansing the soul of every impure thought. To scrub is to get clean by using a hard brush with soap and water: a floor scrubbed until the timber had turned white. Scour has a similar meaning, but the action is even stronger and might involve the use of abrasives, solvents, etc.: to scour the saucepans so that they shone.

这些词指的是清除污垢、杂乱或不需要的物质。清洁是最普遍的，指的是任何使某物摆脱污垢、翻新或净化的方法：用指甲锉清洁她的指甲；用刷子清除靴子上的泥土；用肥皂和水清洁切菜板；清洁和循环空气的机器。当在上述任何例子中用 Cleanse 代替 lean 时，会给出一种奇怪或不恰当的正式语气。在其他用法中，它可能表示特别彻底的清洁或浸泡在水中。最具体地说，它表示仔细的沐浴动作：清洗伤口上的感染物质。当 clean 可能荒谬或太具体时，它也适合用作比喻：清除贪污腐败的行政部门；阳光冲破黑暗，洗去白天的阴郁。这个词在指清除污染或洗去邪恶或罪孽方面也具有特殊的相关性：清除河流中的有毒废物；净化灵魂，摆脱每一个不纯洁的思想。擦洗是指用硬刷子加肥皂和水来清洁：擦洗地板直到木材变白。Scour 具有类似的含义，但动作更强，可能涉及使用研磨剂、溶剂等：擦洗平底锅，使其发亮。

The remaining words concentrate, more mundanely, on some specific aspect inherent in the general suggestions of clean. Dust, most specifically, suggests rubbing, brushing or swabbing to free a surface of loosely accumulated particles: dusting the furniture with an oily cloth. Polish involves not only cleaning by dusting or some other process but also the raising of a high lustre by the use of instruments, pads, waxes, etc. Sweep suggests a cleaning action done specifically with a broom, usually to clean floors of loose dirt: sweeping up the sawdust; sweeping out the kitchen. Wipe specifically suggests a light rubbing or swabbing action, sometimes involving a cloth or rag that may or may not be moistened with water or a cleanser: wiping the dishes with a dry towel; wiping down the steps with a soapy rag; wiping the sweat from his forehead. Tidy suggests the removal of disorder by returning things to their proper place: offering to tidy up after the party. When a housewife cleans house, she scrubs, mops, sweeps and dusts, and also tidies up. But tidy, in contrast to clean, may sound excessively coy or precious in some contexts: going to the powder room to tidy up.

其余词语则更加平凡地集中在一般清洁暗示中固有的某些特定方面。Dust 最具体地表示摩擦、刷洗或擦拭以清除表面松散堆积的颗粒：用油布擦拭家具。Polish 不仅包括通过掸去灰尘或其他过程进行清洁，还包括通过使用工具、垫子、蜡等提高光泽。Sweep 表示专门用扫帚进行的清洁动作，通常用于清除地板上的松散污垢：清扫锯末；清扫厨房。Wipe 具体表示轻轻摩擦或擦拭动作，有时需要使用布或抹布，布或抹布可以沾水或清洁剂，也可以不沾水或清洁剂：用干毛巾擦碗；用沾有肥皂的抹布擦台阶；擦去额头上的汗水。Tidy 表示通过将物品放回原位来消除杂乱：聚会结束后主动收拾。家庭主妇打扫房间时，会擦洗、拖地、扫地、掸灰，还会整理。但与清洁相比，“整理”在某些情况下可能听起来过于含蓄或高贵：去化妆间整理。

4.149 Clear
These words refer to something that stands out in vivid or sharp relief from its surroundings. Clear is the most general and informal of these words. It suggests something that is not the least bit confused, vague or fuzzy, and therefore easy to understand or perceive: clear directions on how to reach the hotel; the clear lettering of the had made poster. Whereas clear may emphasize lack of confusion or ambiguity, distinct is restricted to sharpness of impression or lack of blur: instructions that were clear enough if only she had spoken in a more distinct voice. Distinct can also suggest well-defined outlines: the right focus for getting a distinct image. Or it can suggest something that stands out noticeably: the distinct note of annoyance in her voice.

这些词指的是某物在周围环境中显得生动或鲜明。清晰是这些词中最通用和最不正式的词。它指的是某物有丝毫的混乱、模糊或不模糊，因此很容易理解或察觉：到达酒店的清晰路线；海报上的清晰字体。清晰可能强调没有混乱或歧义，而鲜明则仅限于印象的鲜明或没有模糊：如果她用更清晰的声音说出来，这些指示就足够清楚了。鲜明还可以指明确的轮廓：获得清晰图像的正确焦点。或者它可以指某物引人注目：她声音中明显的恼怒语调。

Definite relates to the lack of ambiguity implied by clear and to the sharpness of outline or impression implied by distinct: setting up definite rules of procedure; a definite litmus reaction that proved the presence of acidity. Unmistakable intensifies the implication of distinct and suggests a noticeable forcefulness not to be overlooked; the word emphasizes the presence of evidence that removes all possibility for doubt: an unmistakable nod of her head; the unmistakable wail of a siren.

明确与清晰所暗示的不模糊性有关，也与独特所暗示的轮廓或印象的清晰有关：制定明确的程序规则；证明酸性存在的明确试金石反应。明确无误地强化了独特的含义，并暗示了不容忽视的明显力量；该词强调了证据的存在，消除了所有怀疑的可能性：她明确地点头；警笛声明确响起。

4.150 Clergyman
These words refer to those members of a religion that are set apart from its ordinary followers either by the responsibilities of leadership or by other duties. Clergyman is the generic term for all men set apart in this way; it applies equally well to leaders of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish faiths: cardinals, bishops and other clergyman who met at the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council in Rome; a conference of Lutheran, Presbyterian and Methodist clergymen; a study group composed of Jewish seminarians and clergymen. Just as clergy contrasts with laity, so clergyman contrasts with laymen to distinguish authorized leaders from ordinary members: a closer relationship between clergymen and laymen. In Christian faiths, the word more specifically indicates someone set apart by ordination, someone who is regularly authorized to preach the gospel and administer sacraments; in addition, it can include in Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican usage anyone who lives in holy orders: priests, monks and other clergymen. At its most general,clergymen may be applied to the leaders of other religions when no more appropriate term from such religions suggests itself.

这些词指的是那些因领导责任或其他职责而与普通信徒不同的宗教信徒。牧师是所有以这种方式被区别开来的人的统称；它同样适用于天主教、新教和犹太教的领袖：在罗马举行的第二次梵蒂冈大公会议上会面的红衣主教、主教和其他神职人员；路德宗、长老会和卫理公会神职人员的会议；由犹太神学院学生和神职人员组成的学习小组。正如神职人员与俗人形成对比一样，牧师与俗人也形成对比，以区分授权领导者和普通成员：神职人员和俗人之间的关系更密切。在基督教信仰中，这个词更具体地表示通过任命而被区别开来的人，即定期被授权传福音和执行圣礼的人；此外，在天主教、东正教和圣公会的用法中，它还包括任何生活在神圣秩序中的人：牧师、僧侣和其他神职人员。最一般地说，当其他宗教中没有更合适的术语时，牧师一词可用于描述其他宗教的领袖。

Cleric may refer, like clergyman, to any member of the clergy, but its use is restricted to the more ritualized or hierarchic faiths. Most specifically it refers to someone distinguished by a tonsure, although it now can suggest any clergyman whose ordination is symbolized by clothing markedly different from that of a layman: a procession of clerics in their colourful regalia. Unlike clergyman, cleric may sometimes give a contemptuous tone when used in criticism, not so much of a church itself, but of church leaders regarded as corrupt: clerics who flout their duties and ignore the needs of the faithful.

和牧师一样，教士这个词也可以指任何神职人员，但其用法仅限于仪式化程度更高或等级森严的宗教。它最具体地指的是剃度出众的人，尽管现在它也可以指任何神职人员，其任命的标志是与普通信徒的服装明显不同：一群身着色彩鲜艳的礼服的神职人员。与牧师不同，教士这个词在用于批评时有时会带有轻蔑的语气，批评的不是教会本身，而是被视为腐败的教会领袖：那些藐视职责、无视信徒需求的神职人员。

Theologian represents a much more specific concept, referring to anyone who formulates or clarifies the doctrines and thinking of a religion; the word may occasionally be applied to members of other than the Western religions: the Hindu theologian Shankara. In any case, the word suggests a learned, philosophical or well-reasoned approach. In theory, theologian can apply to anyone accomplished in such technical discussion, male or female, clergyman or layman. In practice, a theologian has most often been a clergyman of the religion his thinking deals with: the Jewish theologian Maimonides who influence the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas. While the word suggests an official or orthodox approach, this is not always necessarily implied in practice: the theologian Arius whose doctrines were declared heretical in the 4 th century A.D.; recent theologians who formulated the controversial "God-is-dead" theory. While divine may refer in a general way to a clergyman, particularly one highly placed, the word at its most specific refers to a theologian whose doctrines are accepted and honoured by his religion: church divines of the early centuries whose main task was to combat such heresies as Arianism and manicheanism.

神学家代表了一个更为具体的概念，指的是任何制定或阐明宗教教义和思想的人；这个词有时也适用于西方宗教以外的宗教成员：印度神学家商羯罗。无论如何，这个词都暗示着一种博学、哲学或深思熟虑的方法。理论上，神学家可以适用于任何在这种技术讨论中有所成就的人，无论男女，神职人员或外行。在实践中，神学家通常是他所思考的宗教的神职人员：影响圣托马斯·阿奎那思想的犹太神学家迈蒙尼德。虽然这个词暗示着一种官方或正统的方法，但在实践中并不总是必然如此：神学家阿里乌斯，他的学说在公元 4 世纪被宣布为异端邪说；近代神学家提出了有争议的“上帝已死”理论。虽然 divine 通常指牧师，特别是地位很高的牧师，但这个词最具体的含义是指其教义被其宗教所接受和尊崇的神学家：早期教会的神职人员的主要任务是打击阿里乌教派和摩尼教等异端邪说。

Ecclesiastic refers to any clergyman in a church with an emphasis on a clergy arranged in a ranked and structured hierarchy, thus applying particularly to Catholic, Orthodox and such Protestant churches as the Anglican: an ecclesiastic in the Church of England. Prelate more specifically refers to an ecclesiastic of superior rank and authority, as a bishop or cardinal, or to a dignitary of a particular church. This word, even more than cleric, can be given a negative ring by someone critical of the clergy: prelates who grow fat and rich while the people starve.

教士是指教会中的任何牧师，重点是按等级和结构排列的教士，因此特别适用于天主教、东正教和圣公会等新教教会：英国国教的教士。主教更具体地指级别和权威较高的教士，如主教或红衣主教，或某个教会的要员。这个词甚至比牧师这个词更容易被批评教士的人赋予负面含义：主教们发财致富，而人民却在挨饿。

While religious is restricted in reference to someone living in holy orders, usually in the context of the more formalized faiths, the word is unique here in that it applies equally well both to a man or woman in such orders: a girl who wished to become a religious and retire to the sheltered life of the convent. [Not always mandatory for parish priests, celibacy nevertheless was always in force for the religious, both monks and nuns.]

虽然“修女”一词仅限于指生活在圣职中的人，通常是在较为正式的信仰背景下，但这个词在这里却很独特，因为它同样适用于生活在这种圣职中的男人和女人：一个希望成为修女并退休到修道院过受保护生活的女孩。[对于教区牧师来说，独身并不总是强制性的，但对于修女，无论是僧侣还是修女，独身都是强制性的。]

4.151 Climb
Upward movement is indicated by all these words. Climb suggests most strongly a laborious or tortuous moving upwards: the men who climbed Everest; a car slowly climbing the steep hill; an erratic market climbing to new highs; the aircraft climbing to get above the cloudbank. Scale is closely related to climb in suggesting effort-filled upward movement, but it is more often restricted to the actual physical effort required for someone to surmount an obstacle. It also suggests a skilful dexterity or thoughtful effort: those who would scale the heights; scaling the wall to get word to his compatriots. Mount relates to scale and climb in that it can suggest a step-by-step process: slowly mounting the look-out point for a view of the bay; mounting his horse; tidewater slowly mounting the sloping beach.

所有这些词都表示向上的运动。Climb 最强烈地暗示着费力或曲折的向上移动：攀登珠穆朗玛峰的人们；缓慢爬上陡峭山坡的汽车；攀爬至新高的不稳定市场；爬升至云层之上的飞机。Scale 与 climb 密切相关，都暗示着费力的向上运动，但它通常限于某人克服障碍所需的实际体力。它还暗示着熟练的灵巧或深思熟虑的努力：那些愿意攀登高峰的人；攀爬长城给同胞传话的人。Mount 与 scale 和 climb 相关，都暗示着一步一步的过程：慢慢爬上瞭望点，欣赏海湾的景色；骑上他的马；潮水慢慢涌上倾斜的海滩。

Ascend and rise, unlike the foregoing, need not suggest laborious movement up an incline, but may refer instead to perpendicular movement through water or air: the moon ascending a cloudless sky; smoke rising from chimneys. Ascend, when it is used for movement up an incline, is more formal and less vivid than climb: ascending the steep face of the mountain. In metaphorical uses, the word can affect a religious or spiritual overtone: a prayer for peace ascending from the hearts of all men. Rise is even less colourful than ascend; because of its openness to implications provided by context, is has a wide range of abstract uses: if prices rise.

与上述情况不同，Ascend 和 rise 不一定表示费力地爬上斜坡，而可能指在水或空气中的垂直运动：月亮在万里无云的天空中升起；烟囱中冒出烟雾。当用于表示爬上斜坡时，Ascend 比 climb 更正式，但不那么生动：爬上陡峭的山壁。在隐喻用法中，该词可以产生宗教或精神色彩：所有人心中升起对和平的祈祷。Rise 甚至比 climb 更不生动；由于它对上下文提供的含义具有开放性，因此它具有广泛的抽象用法：如果价格上涨。

4.152 Clique
These words refer to a small cluster of friends that excludes outsiders and confers status on those who belong. Of these, clique is the most pejorative in tone and points to the fewest members. It also most strongly suggests both secrecy and snobbishness; in its quasi-official rigidity, in fact, it may all but resemble a social club: a clearly defined clique of teenage girls who set style and fashion for their whole high school; a clique of conservative officers within the War Ministry. No person would describe his closet friends and himself as a clique ?except to disparage them and himself. Circle, by contrast, carries no pejorative judgement and could be used descriptively either by an outsider or by a member of a social cluster: a circle of impressionist painters in the 1890s; my circle of friends. The word implies less intimacy than clique, but does suggest mutuality of interests, frequency of gathering, and possibly, decorous civility carried out on a more formal social scale than clique: Mme. de Staël and her circle of intelligentsia.

这些词指的是一小群朋友，他们排斥外人，赋予内部成员地位。其中，clique 的语气最贬义，指的是成员最少。它也最强烈地暗示着秘密和势利；事实上，在其半官方的僵化中，它可能几乎类似于社交俱乐部：一个由十几岁的女孩组成的明确小圈子，她们为整个高中树立了风格和时尚；战争部内的保守派军官小圈子。没有人会把自己和自己的密友称为小圈子——除非是为了贬低他们和自己。相比之下，circle 不带有贬义，可以由局外人或社交圈的成员用来描述：19 世纪 90 年代的印象派画家圈子；我的朋友圈。这个词暗示的亲密程度不如 clique，但确实暗示了兴趣的共同性、聚会的频率，以及可能在比 clique 更正式的社交规模上进行的得体礼节：Mme. de Staël 和她的知识分子圈子。

Coterie, although more formal than either, more closely resembles clique than circle. It is not necessarily so pejorative as clique, however, and points to a larger cluster of friends with perhaps wider interests, less exclusive status, and with the possibility of greater social fluidity. While every member of a clique or circle, for example, would be well acquainted with every other member, the members of a coterie might be more on a more personal or familiar basis. Also, a clique or circle might point more strictly to sociability as a motivating factor, while coterie may more often suggest some uniting ideal or purpose beyond mere camaraderie: the coterie of Fabian socialists whose ideals were ultimately embodied in the Labour Party.

尽管“小圈子”比上述两种说法都更正式，但它更接近于“派系”而非“圈子”。不过，“小圈子”并不像“派系”那样贬义，它指的是一群更大的朋友，他们的兴趣可能更广泛，地位不那么排他，而且可能具有更大的社会流动性。例如，虽然“派系”或“圈子”中的每个成员都与其他成员很熟悉，但“小圈子”的成员之间可能更亲密或更熟悉。此外，“派系”或“圈子”可能更严格地指社交能力是一种激励因素，而“小圈子”可能更经常地暗示某种超越单纯友情的团结理想或目的：费边社会主义者的小圈子，他们的理想最终体现在工党身上。

Group and set are much less restricted in meaning than these other words. Group, when referring to social clusters, may range in suggestiveness from the intense intimacy of clique to a much vaguer casualness that includes all the friends and acquaintances one happens to have: my group at college; a group of young mothers who met in the park over their prams. Set indicates a much larger group of members than any of these other words; while it may be used more neutrally to indicate a particular social group that can be classified as to status and similar interests. Where clique all but suggests a club, set all but implies a class or caste of people. Most important, members of a set need not even know on another: modish dress that obviously indicated they were members of the fast-living, world-travelling jet set. Set, used of a smaller group, is even more emphatic about status, although this need not approach the snobbishness implicit in clique: falling in with a set of young executives who spend their weekends on the harbour.

Group 和 set 的含义比其他词少得多。Group 在指社会群体时，其暗示性范围从 clique 的亲密关系到包括一个人碰巧拥有的所有朋友和熟人的更模糊的随意性：我在大学时的群体；一群在公园里推着婴儿车相识的年轻妈妈。Set 表示的成员群体比任何其他词都要大得多；但它也可以更中性地用来表示可以根据地位和相似兴趣进行分类的特定社会群体。clique 几乎暗示一个俱乐部，而 set 几乎暗示一个阶级或阶层。最重要的是，一个群体的成员甚至不需要了解另一个群体：时髦的着装显然表明他们是生活节奏快、周游世界的喷气式飞机群体的成员。Set 用于较小的群体，更强调地位，尽管这不需要接近 clique 中隐含的势利：与一群在港口度过周末的年轻高管交往。

4.153 Club
These words all apply to organized groups of people or things. A club suggests intimacy and informality as well as good fellowship. Clubs may be designed for a variety of purposes, but social clubs are usually of an exclusive nature; membership depends upon the personal judgement, feelings or prejudices of the established members rather than upon any objective qualification. Sectional clubs, of course, are less exclusive, but the payment of dues and the attendance of periodic meeting of a more or less social nature characterize all clubs. The word club has lately become popular because of its pleasant connotations of comfort, relaxation and fellowship. Today many people belong to clubs (ex-servicemen’s clubs, sporting clubs of various kinds, businessmen’s clubs) where they may entertain themselves and their friends in an atmosphere different from that prevailing in hotels. We also find this word used in book club, wine club or some other groups constituting potential buyers or patrons. Association applies to more formal and businesslike relationships that may obtain between organizations as well as individuals: the Amateur Athletic Association; the Metal Trades Employers Association; an association of primary producers.

这些词都适用于有组织的人群或事物。俱乐部意味着亲密和非正式以及良好的友谊。俱乐部可以用于各种目的，但社交俱乐部通常具有排他性；会员资格取决于现有会员的个人判断、感受或偏见，而不是任何客观资格。当然，分部俱乐部的排他性较低，但缴纳会费和参加或多或少具有社交性质的定期会议是所有俱乐部的特征。俱乐部这个词最近变得流行起来，因为它具有舒适、放松和友谊的愉快内涵。今天，许多人都加入俱乐部（退伍军人俱乐部、各种体育俱乐部、商人俱乐部），在那里他们可以在不同于酒店的氛围中娱乐自己和朋友。我们还发现这个词用于读书俱乐部、葡萄酒俱乐部或其他一些由潜在买家或顾客组成的团体。协会适用于组织和个人之间可能存在的更正式和更商业化的关系：业余体育协会；金属行业雇主协会；初级生产者的协会。

Federation applies especially to a co-operative organization of states or semi-independent groups for a specific, mutual purpose; as to conduct foreign affairs, or, as in the case of the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, to strengthen the influence of each of its member bodies. The most common sense of union refers to the trade union, an organization of workers that represents the collective interest of its members in dealing with their employer. In another sense union is close to league. A union or league is a combining of forces for some common end: the English Speaking Union; the League of Nations. But union sometimes signifies a closer and more enduring relationship than league: The United States is often called the Union.

联邦尤其适用于由国家或半独立团体组成的合作组织，其目的是实现特定的共同目标；例如开展外交事务，或者像澳大利亚大学教职员工协会联合会那样，加强其各成员机构的影响力。工会最常见的含义是指工会，即代表其成员在与雇主打交道时的集体利益的工人组织。从另一个意义上讲，工会与联盟很接近。工会或联盟是为实现某个共同目标而联合起来的力量：英语联盟；国际联盟。但工会有时比联盟表示更紧密、更持久的关系：美国通常被称为联盟。

Fraternity may refer to a fraternal society such as the Freemasons or to a Greek-letter fraternity of U.S. university students. The latter are usually social and are run very much like clubs; but some fraternities are devoted to service, and others, like Phi Beta Kappa, have an intellectual basis for membership. A lodge is a local branch of a secret or fraternal society. Order denotes a society with common aims and obligations, as a fraternal order or a religious order: The Order of Odd Fellows; the Masonic order; the Franciscan order. A religious order is an organization of monks, nuns or priests who have taken vows pledging themselves to live under a certain discipline or to perform certain social or religious duties.

兄弟会可能指兄弟会，如共济会，或指美国大学生的希腊字母兄弟会。后者通常具有社交性，其运作方式与俱乐部非常相似；但有些兄弟会致力于服务，而另一些兄弟会，如美国大学优等生联谊会，则以知识分子为基础。会所是秘密或兄弟会的地方分支机构。秩序表示具有共同目标和义务的团体，如兄弟会或宗教团体：奇数会；共济会；方济各会。宗教团体是由僧侣、修女或牧师组成的组织，他们发誓要遵守一定的纪律或履行一定的社会或宗教义务。

4.154 Clumsy
These words refer to actions lacking in skill or grace or to the faulty results of such actions. Clumsy indicates blundering or imprecise movement, a propensity for making mistakes, or to results that reflect these things; a clumsy walk; her clumsy attempt to match the colours of the original; a clumsy sweep of his hand that sent the vase toppling; the clumsy dialogue of the play. While the defects suggested by clumsy result from lack of muscular co-ordination, skill, talent or training, awkward suggests similar but less serious defects that stem from misproportion or more especially from an unsettled state of mind: an awkward build; an awkward grammatical construction; a mutual suspicion that made for awkward silences in their talk; shyness that left her flustered and awkward. [One student’s word is sensitive but still awkward; the others are without exception hopelessly clumsy.]

这些词指的是缺乏技巧或优雅的动作，或这些动作导致的错误结果。笨拙表示动作笨拙或不精确，容易犯错，或反映这些情况的结果；笨拙的步态；她笨拙地试图匹配原作的颜色；他笨拙地挥动手，把花瓶打翻了；戏剧中笨拙的对话。笨拙所暗示的缺陷是由于缺乏肌肉协调、技巧、天赋或训练，而尴尬则暗示了类似但不那么严重的缺陷，这些缺陷源于比例失调，尤其是源于不稳定的精神状态：笨拙的体型；笨拙的语法结构；相互猜疑导致谈话中出现尴尬的沉默；害羞使她心慌意乱、尴尬不已。[一个学生的词很敏感，但仍然很尴尬；其他学生无一例外都笨拙得无可救药。]

Bungling specifically stress a propensity for making mistakes, and to an even greater degree than is true for clumsy. It also focuses on the inexpert handling mismanagement of the whole affair. Similarly, inept refers less to physical movement than to an abject and total failure to accomplish a desired result: a completely inept attempt at humour; an inept movie.

笨拙特别强调犯错的倾向，甚至比笨拙更严重。它还侧重于对整个事件的不熟练处理和管理不善。同样，笨拙指的不是身体动作，而是指完全无法达到预期结果：完全笨拙的幽默尝试；一部笨拙的电影。

Ungainly specifically suggests a lack of grace that may or may not result, like awkward, from some innate misproportion: an ungainly attempt to retrieve the fallen serviette; an ungainly body incapable of agile movement. Gawky is much more emphatic about the physical basis of awkward or ungainly action; it may specifically suggest long, thin or attenuated limbs: the usual gawky adolescent. Lumbering, by contrast, suggests ungraceful physical misproportion that stems from an over-heavy or outsized build: the big brute who lumbered after me down the stairs; the slow pace of the lumbering wagon.

Ungainly 特指缺乏优雅，这可能与 tweak 一样，由某种天生的比例失调导致，也可能不是：笨拙地试图捡起掉落的餐巾；笨拙的身体无法敏捷地移动。Gawky 更强调笨拙或笨拙动作的身体基础；它可能特指细长或细弱的四肢：通常笨拙的青少年。相比之下，Lumbering 则指由过重或超大体型导致的比例失调：在我身后笨拙地走下楼梯的那个大块头；笨拙的马车缓慢地行走。

4.155 Clutter
All these words mean a lack of order and arrangement. Clutter implies that objects are jumbled together in heaps, while disorder means that they are not in their normal places. Clutter emphasizes the miscellaneous or various nature of the mess, whereas disorder points to the lack of proper arrangement of the individual objects, and thus usually refers to spatial relationships within an area. [Finding a particular book amidst the clutter of papers and books on his desk was ndeed a challenge; to find a rare clock in the clutter of an antique shop; Burglars left the premises in a state of disorder ?the contents of every cupboard and drawer scattered about the floors.] Disorder may of course refer to any lack of order: riots and civil disorder. Disarray refers specifically to the lack of orderly arrangement, and may apply to people, especially if usually in a disciplined arrangement, as well as to things. [The troops retreated in disarray; The office, usually so neat, was in complete disarray after we moved.] Disarray may also be used of one’s clothing or person. [Her hair was in disarray; Jarred and shaken from his fall, he began to adjust his clothing, which was in a state of disarray.] Disarray is a rather formal or literary word and would be out of place in any informal context.

所有这些词的意思都是缺乏秩序和安排。Clutter 意味着物品杂乱地堆放在一起，而 Disorder 意味着物品不在正常的位置。Clutter 强调混乱的杂乱无章或各种各样的性质，而 Disorder 则指单个物品没有得到适当的排列，因此通常指某个区域内的空间关系。[要在桌子上杂乱无章的文件和书籍中找到一本特定的书确实是一个挑战；要在古董店的杂乱中找到一个稀有的钟；窃贼离开时房间一片混乱——每个橱柜和抽屉里的物品散落在地板上。] Disorder 当然可以指任何缺乏秩序的情况：暴乱和内乱。Disarray 特指缺乏有序的排列，既可以适用于人，尤其是通常排列有序的人，也可以适用于物。[军队溃败而撤退；办公室通常很整洁，但搬走后就变得一片混乱。] 混乱也可用于形容一个人的衣着或人格。[她的头发乱糟糟的；他摔倒后惊慌失措，开始整理乱糟糟的衣服。] 混乱是一个相当正式或文学性的词，在任何非正式的语境中都不合适。

Confusion, as here considered, suggests that things are so disordered that it is difficult to identify the individual objects in the general clutter: Burglars left things scattered in such confusion that it was days before we knew what had been stolen. Confusion refers also to a mental state: the confusion in his mind about what really happened in the accident. Chaos implies both extreme disorder and nearly total confusion: After the bombing attack, the city was in a state of chaos.

此处的混乱是指事物杂乱无章，难以在一片混乱中辨认出单个物体：窃贼把东西乱七八糟地丢在地上，几天后我们才知道被偷了什么。混乱也指一种精神状态：他心中对事故中真正发生的事情感到困惑。混乱既意味着极度混乱，也意味着几乎完全混乱：爆炸袭击后，这座城市处于一片混乱状态。

4.156 Coincide
These words all refer to close similarity in relationship between separate things. Coincide, correspond and tally are related in their application to two or more things that conform to one another or share certain characteristics. Coincide means to conform exactly ?to have identical elements. [The birthdays of twins usually coincide; It is fortunate when a young man’s career goals and the wishes of his parents for him coincide.] To correspond is to have comparable elements. A national dish may correspond to one in the cuisine of another culture; evidence given in court should correspond with the facts in the case. Tally means to correspond in the sense of being consistent with. [The calculations of two scientists working on the same problem tallied exactly; Saying that the earth is flat does not tally with scientific observations.] Jibe is a colloquial term which, like tally, emphasizes the accordance or consistency of facts, elements, relations, etc.: His version of the accident should jibe with that of the other witnesses. Jibe thus points to fitting into an overall consistent pattern rather than a point-by-point correspondence between two separate things.
	
这些词都指独立事物之间关系的密切相似性。Coincide、correspond 和 tally 在应用于两个或多个彼此一致或具有某些共同特征的事物时相关。Coincide 的意思是完全一致 - 具有相同的元素。[双胞胎的生日通常重合；如果年轻人的职业目标和父母对他的期望一致，那他就很幸运了。] 对应是指具有可比的元素。一种国家菜肴可能与另一种文化的菜肴相对应；法庭上提供的证据应该与案件中的事实相符。Tally 的意思是一致。[研究同一问题的两位科学家的计算完全一致；说地球是平的与科学观察不符。] Jibe 是一个口语术语，与 tally 一样，强调事实、要素、关系等的一致或一致性：他对事故的说法应该与其他证人的一致。因此，Jibe 指的是符合整体一致的模式，而不是两个独立事物之间的逐点对应。

Agree is the most general word in this list, and in this context stresses the sharing of like characteristics, attitudes or elements. It can be used in place of each of the other words in this list in many construction. [His version of the accident should agree (jibe, correspond) with that of the other witnesses; plans agree (or coincide); figures agree (or tally).] Agree can indicate any degree of likeness, from a slight similarity to virtual identity.

同意是此列表中最常用的词，在此上下文中强调分享相同的特征、态度或元素。它可以在许多结构中代替此列表中的其他每个词。[他对事故的看法应该与其他目击者一致（嘲笑、对应）；计划一致（或一致）；数字一致（或相符）。] 同意可以表示任何程度的相似性，从轻微的相似性到虚拟身份。

4.157 Cold
These words refer to a relatively low temperature or to an unexcited, disconcerted or unfriendly attitude. In reference to temperature, cold may refer to something desirably low-key: a cold drink on a hot day. Aside from this situation, however, the word more often connotes an unpleasantly low temperature: cold weather; a cold wind; numbed through in the cold rooms. Frigid and frosty are intensifications of cold, specifically referring to a temperature below freezing. Frigid factually stresses something that has been frozen solid or a temperature permitting this: a week of absolutely frigid weather. Frosty may suggest a slightly warmer temperature, one at which frost first begins to form or breath vapour can be seen: windows turning frosty overnight; frosty winter gales. Like frigid, gelid and icy imply a temperature cold enough to result in the production of ice: a gelid mass of hailstones; a clear but icy day. Icy may also be merely a hyperbole for cold: icy waters.

这些词指的是相对较低的温度，或一种不兴奋、不安或不友好的态度。在指温度时，cold 可能指某种令人向往的低调事物：炎热天气下的冷饮。然而，除了这种情况之外，这个词更常表示令人不快的低温：寒冷的天气；冷风；在寒冷的房间里浑身麻木。Frigid 和 frosty 是 cold 的加强版，特指低于冰点的温度。Frigid 实际上强调的是已经冻结的东西或允许冻结的温度：一周的极寒天气。Frosty 可能表示温度略高，霜冻开始形成或可以看到呼吸蒸汽：窗户一夜之间结霜；寒冷的冬季大风。与 frigid 一样，gelid 和 icy 也表示温度低到足以产生冰：冰冻的冰雹；晴朗但冰冷的日子。Icy 也可能只是 cold 的夸张说法：冰冷的水。

In reference to temperature, cool often suggests something pleasant or mildly low-key: a heat wave followed by cool weather; a winter that was cool but not cold; moving from the direct sun into the cool shade. Chilled refers to someone who has become cold or something that has been caused to turn cool: chilled to the bone; chilled wine. Chilly, by contrast, refers more often to air or weather midway between cool and cold: a chilly autumn wind; a chilly house. The word, in fact, may suggest an erratic coming and going of winds: chilly gusts.

就温度而言，cool 通常表示令人愉快或略微低调的事物：热浪过后天气凉爽；冬天凉爽但不冷；从阳光直射的地方移到凉爽的树荫下。Chilled 表示变冷的人或变冷的事物：冰凉透骨；冰镇葡萄酒。相比之下，chilly 更多地表示介于凉爽和寒冷之间的空气或天气：寒冷的秋风；寒冷的房子。事实上，这个词可能表示风来去无常：寒冷的阵风。

When these words refer to emotional states, their interrelations differ. Cold may refer to an unresponsive attitude or, more drastically, to hostility: a book he remained cold to from beginning to end; giving him a cold look. In their greater intensity, frosty and icy usually stress the hostility implicit in cold: replying to her with frosty disdain; moving with an icy anger. Frigid, however, is now so often used specifically of sexual unresponsiveness in women that it may sound odd or comic in any other emotional context: psychotherapy for the frigid woman.

当这些词指代情绪状态时，它们之间的关系有所不同。冷漠可能指一种不回应的态度，或者更极端地指敌意：他对一本书从头到尾都保持冷淡；给他一个冷漠的眼神。在强度较大时，frosty 和 icy 通常强调冷漠中隐含的敌意：用冷漠的蔑视回应她；带着冷酷的愤怒行事。然而，frigid 现在经常被用来专门描述女性对性冷漠的态度，以至于在任何其他情绪背景下，它听起来都很奇怪或滑稽：针对性冷漠女性的心理治疗。

Cool suggests reserve based on shyness, lack of enthusiasm, or disapproval: a cool response to all his proposals; curt answers filled with a cool contempt. The word may also suggest an ability to remain objective or impartial or to avoid anger or panic: sorting out the arguments with a cool objectivity; keeping a cool head during the crisis. Chilly suggests manners that are stand-offish or openly hostile: bidding a chilly goodnight to the guests who had overstayed. Chilled, by contrast, pertains mostly to a discouraged or horrified reaction to something else: chilled to see our dwindling store of ammunition.

Cool 表示因害羞、缺乏热情或反对而产生的保留态度：对他的所有提议都冷淡回应；充满冷漠蔑视的简短回答。这个词也可能表示保持客观或公正或避免愤怒或恐慌的能力：以冷静的客观态度解决争论；在危机中保持冷静的头脑。Chilly 表示冷淡或公开敌对的举止：向逾期逗留的客人冷淡道晚安。相比之下，Chilled 主要指对其他事情感到沮丧或恐惧的反应：看到我们的弹药库正在减少而感到冷静。

Gelid has a rather literary tone and connotes the kind of cold numbness produced by unfriendliness, hostility, fear or horror: nervous laughter that turned into gelid silence when she realized his murderous intent.

冰冷的语气相当文学化，暗示着由不友好、敌意、恐惧或恐怖产生的那种冰冷的麻木：当她意识到他的杀人意图时，紧张的笑声变成了冰冷的沉默。

4.158 Colour
All these words mean to impart colour to something. To colour is the most general of these words, and stipulates neither the extent of the process nor the material used nor the object coloured.

所有这些词的意思都是给某物上色。着色是这些词中最通用的，既不规定着色过程的范围，也不规定所用的材料，也不规定着色的物体。

To dye means to permanently change the colour of something, as abric or hair, by impregnating it with a colouring agent: to dye a white ress red by soaking it for several hours in a dyeing solution.

染色意味着通过用着色剂浸渍某物（如布料或头发）来永久改变其颜色：将白色衣物浸泡在染色溶液中数小时，使其染成红色。

To stain means either to colour an object chemically, as to stain wood, or to impart to an object a colour foreign to it through use, negligence or the like, as to stain one’s clothing with spilt soup.

染色意味着用化学方法给物体染色，例如给木头染色，或者由于使用、疏忽或类似原因给物体带来外来的颜色，例如用洒出的汤染色衣服。

To paint is to apply colour to an object or a surface for the purpose of decorating it, as to paint a chair or a wall. The substance used in painting is usually a durable one that preserves as well as decorates.

绘画是指将颜色涂在物体或表面上以达到装饰目的，例如给椅子或墙壁上色。绘画所用的材料通常很耐用，既能保存，又能起到装饰作用。

To tint and to tinge means to colour something slightly. To tint is to impart a light or pastel colour for decorative purpose; to tinge is to modify the basic colour of something slightly or superficially, as to tinge ivory yellow by frequent handling.

着色和淡化是指给某物稍微上色。着色是为了装饰目的而赋予浅色或柔和的颜色；淡化是指稍微或表面地改变某物的基本颜色，例如通过频繁处理将象牙染成黄色。

4.159 Combustible
These words are all used to describe material that can catch fire. Combustible is the most formal term here and also the most neutral in simply denoting material that will burn easily: Combustible building materials such as laths have been replaced by highly fire-resistant materials such as asbestos fibre-board.

这些词都用来描述易燃材料。可燃性是这里最正式的术语，也是最中性的术语，仅表示易燃材料：可燃建筑材料（如板条）已被高防火材料（如石棉纤维板）取代。

Burnable is at the other end of the scale from combustible in its relaxed, almost slangy tone. It is also less neutral in pointing to a desired or desirable quality: Boy Scouts scouring the scrub for every burnable stick of firewood.

Burnable 与 Combusible 截然相反，其语气轻松，几乎带有俚语意味。它在指代一种理想或令人向往的品质时也不那么中性：童子军在灌木丛中搜寻每一根可燃的木柴。

Inflammable and flammable are identical in meaning and are frequently used as warning signs to label hazardous material that may result in unwanted fires unless handled with caution: Combustible substances such as phosphorus must not be shipped without "flammable" clearly written across the container. Flammable has begun to replace inflammable as the word of warning, primarily because to many people confused inflammable with its opposite, non-flammable.

易燃和易燃的含义相同，经常用作警告标志，标明危险材料，如果不小心处理，可能会导致不必要的火灾：运输磷等易燃物质时，必须在容器上清楚地写上“易燃”。易燃已经开始取代易燃作为警告词，主要是因为许多人将易燃与其反义词不易燃混淆。

4.160 Come
These words refer to movement towards a goal. Come is the most informal and general of these words. Its emphasis is on movement towards the observer or movement seen from the perspective of the intended or likely goal: the man coming towards me; trains coming into and leaving the station. The word can indicate the actual appearance of something at the goal, but it can also indicate mere movement towards something without suggesting that it is or will be achieved: He was coming home from work when the accident occurred.

这些词指的是朝着目标的移动。Come 是这些词中最不正式和最通用的。它的重点是朝着观察者移动或从预期或可能的目标角度看到的移动：朝我走来的男人；进站和出站的火车。这个词可以表示目标处某物的实际出现，但它也可以表示仅仅朝着某物移动而不表明它已经或将要实现：事故发生时，他正下班回家。

With the remaining words, there is no suggestion of movement either towards or away from the observer. In contrast to come, arrive stresses the actual achievement of a goal: If he were coming, he would have arrived by now ?unless something happened to him along the way. The word is otherwise neutral in its overtones, suggesting in itself neither ease nor effort of movement. At its most neutral, reach can suggest a midway point or stop in an ongoing movement: having reached the third chapter before realizing what the author was getting at; hoping to reach Milan by nightfall and Venice the next day. When the word applies to the achievement of a final goal, however, it often suggests the culmination of a slow, painstaking or methodical process: reaching the summit of Everest after years of planning and countless failures. At any rate, the word can suggest more effort than arrive or possibly the working through of a devious or uncertain course: reaching the address after picking his way through a maze of sinuous streets. Gain intensifies the implications of effort inherent in reach. Successful struggle against odds or in the face of peril or uncertainty can be suggested by the word: gaining the embattled city after heavy casualties. Often, the word specifically suggests upward movement: gaining a precarious perch from which to view the procession.

其余的词，没有暗示朝向观察者或远离观察者的运动。与 come 相反，arrice 强调目标的实际实现：如果他来了，他现在就到了——除非他在路上发生了什么事。这个词的其他含义是中性的，本身既不暗示运动的轻松，也不暗示运动的努力。在最中性的情况下，reach 可以暗示正在进行的运动的中途点或停止点：在读到第三章时才意识到作者的意思；希望在夜幕降临时到达米兰，第二天到达威尼斯。然而，当这个词用于实现最终目标时，它通常暗示一个缓慢、艰苦或有条不紊的过程的高潮：经过多年的计划和无数次失败后到达珠穆朗玛峰的顶峰。无论如何，这个词可以比 reach 暗示更多的努力，或者可能是一条曲折或不确定的路线的完成：在穿过蜿蜒的街道迷宫后到达地址。Gain 强化了 reach 所固有的努力含义。成功战胜困难或面对危险或不确定性的斗争可以用以下词语来表示：在伤亡惨重后占领被围困的城市。通常，该词语特别表示向上运动：占据一个可以观看游行的险峻位置。

4.161 Comfort
These words refer to a feeling or situation of pleasurable serenity. Comfort suggests the possession of complete peace of mind and physical contentment, either through the satisfaction of all needs and desires or through the elimination of anything unpleasant or disturbing: airlines that vie with each other over details of passenger comfort; prescribing a pill that would allow him to sleep in comfort; beachgoers seeking comfort from the heat wave. Relief is specifically restricted to this last possibility of comfort, stressing the removal of unpleasant or painful stimuli. Even here, relief is more restricted to expressing the mere absence of negative elements, whereas comfort might suggest replacing them with something positive: a medication for relief of sunburn; finding relief from his doubts but little comfort in the new doctrine.

这些词指的是一种令人愉悦的宁静的感觉或情况。舒适意味着拥有完全的心灵平静和身体满足，要么通过满足所有的需求和愿望，要么通过消除任何不愉快或令人不安的事物：航空公司在乘客舒适度细节上相互竞争；开出一种可以让他睡得舒服的药丸；海滩游客在热浪中寻求安慰。缓解特别局限于最后一种安慰的可能性，强调消除不愉快或痛苦的刺激。即使在这里，缓解也仅限于表达负面因素的缺失，而舒适可能意味着用积极的东西取而代之：一种缓解晒伤的药物；从他的疑虑中找到解脱，但在新教义中却得不到安慰。

Ease and relaxation refer exclusively to positive states and so relate to a side of comfort in contrast to simple relief. Ease has the widest range of any of these words, referring to things that make for contentment, like comfort, but going beyond this word to suggest utter naturalness, lack of tension, or profound mental and physical peacefulness: taking our ease in the cool of the garden; the ease with which she made the arrangements; a smile that put us immediately at ease; never having felt so full of ease in his life. Relaxation is much more limited in reference than ease; it refers particularly to a state of freedom from or dwindling away of tension: a secluded corner where he could work with complete relaxation; a relaxation of hostilities; arm muscles paired in a continual opposition of tension and relaxation. The word also has a special informal use to pertain to recreation: asking him what he did for relaxation. Leisure is the most restricted of these words in relating exclusively to this last use of relaxation. Leisure refers, most specifically, to one’s free time after work, regardless of how the time is spent: having the leisure to pursue a new hobby; executives who carry office tensions to the leisure of the golf course.

安逸和放松专指积极状态，因此与简单的放松相反，与舒适有关。安逸是这些词语中含义最广的，指让人感到满足的事物，如舒适，但又超越了这个词的含义，表示完全自然、没有压力或深刻的身心安宁：在凉爽的花园中悠闲地享受；她安排的轻松；一个让我们立刻放松的微笑；他一生中从未感到如此轻松。放松的指称范围比安逸要有限得多；它特别指一种摆脱或逐渐减轻压力的状态：一个僻静的角落，他可以在那里完全放松地工作；敌对情绪的放松；手臂肌肉成对，持续紧张和放松的对立。这个词还有一种特殊的非正式用法，与休闲有关：问他为了放松做了什么。休闲是这些词语中最受限制的，仅与放松的最后这种用法有关。休闲具体来说是指下班后的自由时间，无论这段时间是如何度过的：有闲暇去追求新的爱好；高管们把办公室的紧张情绪带到高尔夫球场的休闲时光。

Rest and repose are an intensification of possibilities for ease, suggesting an extreme peacefulness and a quiescence approaching sleep. Rest, in fact, may be used synonymously with sleep, or as a group word to include both waking and sleeping relaxation: recommending plenty of rest for the patient following the operation. As this example shows, rest may be used like relief to suggest a restorative process. Repose is the most formal of these words here and gives a lyrical tone. It suggests an utter stillness or lack of movement, implying a complete cessation of both desire and tension. Where relaxation can suggest a noisy letting off of steam, repose always suggests a profound quiet, as of contemplation: a repose so deep that he didn’t hear the conductor asking for his ticket; the town’s old-world sense of decorum and repose.

Rest 和 repose 是轻松可能性的强化，暗示着极度的平和和接近睡眠的宁静。事实上，Rest 可以与 sleep 同义使用，也可以作为一个词组，包括清醒和睡眠时的放松：建议患者在手术后充分休息。如本例所示，rest 可以像 relief 一样用来暗示恢复过程。Repose 是此处这些词中最正式的，给人一种抒情的语调。它暗示着完全的静止或缺乏运动，意味着欲望和紧张的完全停止。relaxation 可以暗示吵闹的发泄，而 repose 总是暗示着深刻的安静，就像沉思一样：他休息得如此之深，以至于没有听到售票员问他要票；小镇的旧世界礼仪和安宁感。

4.162 Comfortable
These words mean feeling or conducing to a feeling of contentment, relief or well-being. Comfortable is the most general word in the group and can apply to a variety of personal feelings and to anything that contributes to those feelings. [I feel very comfortable in this chair; The house is not comfortable tonight because of the high humidity; He makes no more than a barely comfortable income, The patient complained that he had not spent a comfortable night.]

这些词的意思是感到或导致一种满足、宽慰或幸福的感觉。舒适是这组词中最通用的词，可以适用于各种个人感受以及任何有助于这些感受的事物。[我坐在这把椅子上感觉很舒服；今晚房子不太舒服，因为湿度很高；他的收入仅够勉强维持生计；病人抱怨他没有度过一个舒适的夜晚。]

Cosy and snug are suggestive of the kind of comfort that comes from warmth, a compact shelter, security and an easy friendliness: to spend a cosy evening in front of a fireplace; a snug holiday cottage that’s just big enough, and isn’t too much of a housekeeping burden for my wife; a snug job that keeps his family well provided for; a cosy dinner party with a few dear old friends.

温馨和舒适让人联想到温暖、紧凑的庇护所、安全和轻松的友好：在壁炉前度过一个舒适的夜晚；一间舒适的度假小屋，大小适中，不会给妻子带来太大的家务负担；一份舒适的工作，让家人得到很好的照顾；与几个亲密的老朋友一起享用舒适的晚餐。

Restful implies the comfort that comes from being quiet, at rest or in repose. It also describes anything that induces such comfort. [It was restful to sit on the beach, watching the gentle lapping of the waves; The marketplace was strangely restful at night since no one lived there even though thousands worked in it by day.]

宁静意味着安静、休息或休憩带来的舒适感。它也描述任何能带来这种舒适感的事物。[坐在海滩上，看着海浪轻轻拍打，感觉很宁静；市场在晚上出奇地宁静，因为虽然白天有成千上万的人在里面工作，但没有人住在那里。]

4.163 Command
These words pertain either to an authoritative statement that someone is to do something or to the giving of knowledgeable advice or guidance. Command and order are the least formal of these words referring to the stated demand of a superior. Of these, command is the more formal and more general; it may pertain to an overall plan that is to be executed, whereas order might pertain more to a limited action or to a detailed part of such a plan: They received headquarters?command to attack at dawn, together with the special orders each unit was to follow. In addition, command is more forceful, peremptory, and less impersonal: Your wish is my command; a standing order to remain in uniform during off-duty hours. But command can refer to a position of control: the general’s ten-year command of the infantry division.

这些词既可以指某人要做某事的权威声明，也可以指给出专业的建议或指导。在指上级的明确要求时，命令和指令是最不正式的词。其中，命令更正式、更笼统；它可能指要执行的总体计划，而指令可能更指有限的行动或此类计划的详细部分：他们接到总部命令，于黎明发起进攻，同时接到各部队要遵循的特殊命令。此外，命令更有力、更专横，更不冷漠：您的愿望就是我的命令；下班后必须穿制服的常规命令。但命令可以指控制职位：将军对步兵师的十年指挥。

Directive an injunction are considerably more formal than the foregoing and are much more limited and specific in their application. Injunction now pertains mostly to a legal context, there it indicates a court order which is backed by the threat of strenuous punishment for disobedience. An injunction often takes the form of a command to refrain from a specified action: an injunction that prevented the building contractor from working at night. Directive refers to orders, often detailed at length, which those in command send down through channels to gain the compliance of all affected personnel. Where the previous words can suggest either oral or written statements, directive most often suggests written guidelines for action. The word can seem to apply, euphemistically, to advice that carries no explicit threat of punishment for disobedience; but the rulings of a directive are usually mandatory and beyond appeal: a directive isused to all executives concerning a step-up in production during the next quarter; a battalion’s directive on changes in the dress uniform; the vice-chancellor’s directive on admission procedure.

指令和禁令比上述两种命令正式得多，而且在应用上也更加有限和具体。禁令现在主要涉及法律背景，它表示法院命令，并威胁对不服从者进行严厉惩罚。禁令通常以命令的形式出现，命令禁止采取特定行动：禁止建筑承包商在夜间工作的禁令。指令是指指挥官通过渠道下达的命令，通常详细而详细，以获得所有受影响人员的遵守。前面的词可以表示口头或书面声明，而指令通常表示书面行动指南。这个词似乎可以委婉地适用于不服从者没有明确惩罚威胁的建议；但指令的裁决通常是强制性的，不可上诉：指令用于所有高管，涉及下个季度的产量提升；营队关于更换制服的指令；副校长关于录取程序的指令。

Direction and instruction both have applications referring to ordersthat may not be contravened; in this sense both are extremely formal.　Direction would suggest a less detailed verbal or written statement　than directive; it is also less forceful and more euphemistic in tone: a　direction on staff-appointment practices that was sent down to the　personnel department. Often it can apply to informative but mandatory　guidelines: the company’s directions concerning the issuance of new　share certificates. In the context of orders, instruction stresses that a desired action cannot be done without including the necessary information as part of the command: junior officers awaiting the instructions of the company commander; the judge’s instructions to the jurors; she left detailed instructions to the maid about preparations for the party. When the giving of information is not suggested by the word, it can be even more euphemistic than direction: the sergeant’s instruction to fall out for reveille.

指示和指令都可用于指不可违反的命令；从这个意义上讲，两者都非常正式。指示比指令更不详细，口头或书面陈述也不太详细；它的语气也更委婉，比如下发给人员任命部门的关于人员任命做法的指示。它通常适用于信息性但强制性的指导方针：公司关于发行新股票证书的指示。在命令的语境中，指令强调，如果不将必要的信息作为命令的一部分，就无法完成期望的行动：初级军官等待连长指示；法官对陪审员的指示；她给女仆留下了关于派对准备工作的详细指示。当这个词没有暗示提供信息时，它可能比指示更委婉：中士指示在起床号响起时出发。

The last pair pertain more often and less formally to the giving of knowledgeable advice or guidance. In the plural, both can indicate a programmatic or diagrammatic plan for a relatively complicated actions that one wishes or chooses to perform. Directions would be more appropriate for a one-time action, instructions for an action one may wish to learn by heart or perform more than once: printed directions for assembling the components of the sound system; instructions for using the electric frying pan. Direction can apply, of course, to information about reaching a place: She asked for directions to get to the railway station. Instruction most commonly relates to an entirely separate context pertaining to teaching and learning.

最后一对名词更常用于非正式地提供知识性的建议或指导。在复数形式中，两者都可以表示一个人希望或选择执行的相对复杂的操作的纲领性或图解计划。Direction 更适合一次性操作，用于一个人可能希望记住或执行多次的操作的说明：印刷的组装音响系统组件的说明；使用电煎锅的说明。当然，Direction 可以用于有关到达某个地方的信息：她询问了去火车站的路线。Instruction 最常见的是与教学和学习有关的完全独立的环境有关。

4.164 Commit
These words are concerned with carrying out an action. Commit, in this sense, is used mostly in reference to acts which are looked on with disapproval or disfavour: committing a crime; committing suicide. Perpetrate is even more restricted than commit to negative sense, meaning to be guilty of, to perform atrociously or to act deceitfully: to perpetrate a miscarriage of justice; to perpetrate such an inexcusably bad piece of writing; perpetrating a secret plot against the government.

这些词与执行某项行动有关。从这个意义上讲，commit 主要用于指那些不被认可或不被喜欢的行为：犯罪；自杀。perpetrate 的负面含义比 commit 更有限，意为犯下罪行、做出残暴行为或欺骗行为：犯下冤假错案；写出如此不可原谅的糟糕文章；密谋反对政府。

Dispatch and discharge contrast with commit and perpetrate by mainly emphasizing approval for the manner in which a task is done. Dispatch suggests efficiency or speed of performance: dispatching the unpleasant job with extreme care. Discharge suggests the able or faultless performance of a duty or obligation: discharging his promise to work directly with the poor. Sometimes, however, discharge can suggest a literal or minimal rather than an inspired performance: discharging the responsibilities of his job only listlessly and reluctantly.

Dispatch 和 discharge 与 commit 和 perpetrate 形成对比，主要强调对完成任务的方式的认可。Dispatch 表示执行的效率或速度：极其小心地处理不愉快的工作。Discharge 表示能够或完美地履行职责或义务：履行直接为穷人服务的诺言。然而，discharge 有时候可能表示一种字面或最低限度的而不是鼓舞人心的表现：只是无精打采、不情愿地履行工作职责。

Do is the least formal and most general of these words and carries no implications whatever about how a task is carried out: doing the job brilliantly; doing greater harm as a private citizen than he had as Prime Minister.

“做”是这些词中最不正式、最笼统的，它不包含任何关于如何完成任务的含义：出色地完成工作；作为普通公民造成的危害比担任首相时更大。

4.165 Communicable
These words are used to describe diseases. Communicable and contagious are synonymous in designating that kind of disease which is conveyed by direct contact with an affected person or animal, or by contact with a secretion or discharge or by some article touched by him or it. Measles can be called either a communicable or a contagious disease. Communicable is a broader term than contagious in that it is also applied to diseases which are transmitted by some intermediary agent such as an insect. Malaria and yellow fever are examples of such communicable diseases. Infection refers to a disease which is caused by the invasion organism, especially bacteria and protozoa. Botulism and wound infections are infections diseases. Catching is an informal word used in place of all three of the other terms but more often as a substituted for communicable and contagious than for infections.

这些词用于描述疾病。传染性 和 感染性 是同义词，都是指通过直接接触患病的人或动物，或接触分泌物、排泄物或人或动物接触过的物品而传播的疾病。麻疹既可以称为传染性疾病，也可以称为感染性疾病。传染性比感染性更为广泛，因为它也适用于通过昆虫等中介体传播的疾病。疟疾和黄热病就是这类传染病的例子。感染是指由入侵生物（尤其是细菌和原生动物）引起的疾病。肉毒杆菌中毒和伤口感染都属于感染性疾病。传染性是一个非正式用语，用来代替其他三个术语，但更多时候代替传染性 和 感染性，而不是感染。


4.166 Compact
These words refer to confinement or weightiness in a relatively small space. Compact in its most general use suggests a physique that is small but firm and shapely. In a more specific and technical sense, compact suggests that the essentials of something useful have been reduced to a smaller scale for convenience: a compact car; compact luggage for air travel. An intensification of this trend towards utilitarian smallness is designated by the fairly recent miniaturized, which refers to the making of smaller and smaller electronic equipment through the use of transistors; this makes the inclusion of more equipment feasible in situations where bulk and weight are critical, as in space travel: the miniaturized computer; the miniaturized radio.

这些词指的是在相对狭小的空间内的受限或重量。紧凑在最常见的用法中是指体型虽小但坚固而匀称。从更具体和技术的意义上讲，紧凑是指为了方便起见，将有用的东西的要素缩小到更小的规模：紧凑型汽车；航空旅行用的紧凑型行李箱。这种功利主义小型化趋势的强化以最近的微型化为标志，微型化指的是通过使用晶体管制造出越来越小的电子设备；这使得在体积和重量至关重要的情况下可以包含更多的设备，例如在太空旅行中：微型计算机；微型收音机。

Solid and dense emphasize weightiness, but solid does not necessarily suggest reduction to a small space, only the rigidity or firmness of a material. In reference to a physique, it suggests one without fat or flabbiness: solid muscle. Dense suggests the crowding of a heavy substance into a confined space; it may, unlike solid, refer to gases or liquids as well as solids: dense fog; a dense forest.

坚实和稠密强调重量，但坚实并不一定意味着缩小到很小的空间，而只是材料的刚性或坚固性。指体格时，它表示没有脂肪或松弛：坚实的肌肉。稠密表示将重物质挤入密闭空间；与固体不同，它可能指气体或液体以及固体：浓雾；茂密的森林。

Concise, condensed and compressed suggest progressively greater confinement in space; one use of this progression is to suggest brevity in writing or a lack of wordiness. Concise suggests the use of exactly as many words as are required to express something and no more; it would apply more usually to technical, factual work, but may apply to imaginative prose: a concise report; the concise sentences of Hemingway. Condensed suggests the boiling sown of a longer piece of writing to its rudiments: a condensed book. Compressed suggests extreme conciseness, but not necessarily that something longer has been shortened: a compressed statement that will explain the already condensed report. Condensed and compressed also have specific uses in the physical sciences. Condensed refers to the heating of a liquid so that water is driven off and a denser or semi-solid substance remains: condensed milk. Compressed in this context refers to the putting of a gas under pressure to make it occupy less space: compressed air.

简洁、浓缩和压缩暗示着空间的限制逐渐增大；这种递进的用法之一是暗示写作简洁或不冗长。简洁暗示着使用的词语数量恰好足以表达某事，不多不少；它通常更适用于技术性、事实性的工作，但也可能适用于富有想象力的散文：简洁的报告；海明威的简洁句子。浓缩暗示着将较长的文章煮沸至其基本内容：浓缩的书。压缩暗示着极其简洁，但不一定是将较长的内容缩短了：用压缩的语句来解释已经浓缩的报告。浓缩和压缩在物理科学中也有特定用途。浓缩是指加热液体，使水分蒸发，剩下更致密或半固体的物质：炼乳。在这种情况下，压缩是指对气体施加压力，使其占用更少的空间：压缩空气。

Constricted suggests extreme confinement in general, with an added note of uncomfortable limitation: constricted movement in the crowded bus.

收缩通常表示极度受限，还带有一种不舒服的限制感：在拥挤的公交车上行动受限。

4.167 Compare
These words refer to things that are roughly similar but not exactly alike. Compare suggests that one thing is like another in some significant way, however unlike in others: a war that compares to the Korean conflict in its evident stalemate of constructive alternatives. In the imperative, the word may also be an invitation to regard two things side by side in order to note their differences as well as their similarities: Compare these examples of Rembrandt’s early and late styles. Resemble is not readily used in the imperative, but otherwise it is closely related to compare. Its stress, however, is on a closer likeness, indicating that on thing compares in a number of ways to something else. Also, the word carries a stronger visual suggestion than compare: children who resemble their mother; a girl who resembled someone I used to know; an argument that resembles an earlier but now discredited theory.

这些词指的是大致相似但不完全相同的事物。比较表明一件事物在某些重要方面与另一件事物相似，但在其他方面却不同：一场与朝鲜战争相比的战争，其建设性选择的僵局明显。在祈使句中，这个词也可能是邀请人们将两件事物并列看待，以注意它们的不同点和相似点：比较一下伦勃朗早期和晚期风格的这些例子。类似在祈使句中不太常用，但除此之外，它与比较密切相关。但它的重点在于更紧密的相似性，表明一件事物在很多方面可以与其他事物进行比较。此外，这个词比比较带有更强烈的视觉暗示：与母亲相似的孩子；与我以前认识的某个人相似的女孩；与早期但现在已被推翻的理论相似的论点。

In many uses correspond is a more formal word for ideas suggested by resemble: an activist movement that corresponds to similar movements in the 1930s. The word has its own area of meaning, however, in suggesting things that are alike in that they match or complement each other: an availability of funds that seldom corresponds to the needs of units at work in the field. Parallel can also be used as a more formal substitute for resemble, but most often it suggests the separateness of two similar things: space research in Russia which parallels that in the United States; proposals that not only paralleled but actually preceded Darwin’s.

在很多用法中，correspond 是一个更正式的词，用来表示 Similar 所提出的想法：与 20 世纪 30 年代的类似运动相对应的激进运动。然而，该词有其自己的意义，即表示相似的东西，它们彼此匹配或互补：资金的可用性很少与现场工作单位的需求相对应。Parallel 也可以用作 Similar 的更正式替代词，但它最常用于表示两个相似事物的独立性：俄罗斯的太空研究与美国的太空研究相似；不仅与达尔文的提议相似，而且实际上早于达尔文的提议。

With approximate, the emphasis is on the roughness of the likeness: a bill that only approximated the demands of the opposition. The word may also suggest that one thing falls short of matching another in obvious fashions. Approach is like approximate in suggesting that one thing cannot measure up to something with which it is compared; the special emphasis here, however, is on quantity or volume: share-market levels that only approached previous highs. Often, the word emphasizes a lower level: a book that approaches his others in quality.

近似强调的是相似的程度：法案仅近似于反对派的要求。该词也可能暗示一件事在明显方面不如另一件事。近似与近似一样，暗示一件事无法与它所比较的​​东西相提并论；然而，这里特别强调的是数量或成交量：股票市场水平仅接近先前的高点。通常，该词强调较低的水平：一本书在质量上接近其他书。

Savour of suggests that one thing only vaguely compares to another in some almost elusive way. Thus the amount of similarity suggested is even less than for approximate and approach: a novel that savours of a feeble attempt to mimic Joyce; a northern port that nevertheless somehow savoured of the Mediterranean in its whitewashed houses and tiled roofs. While savour of can suggest equally well an advantageous or unfortunate likeness, the more pungent and colloquial smack of almost exclusively suggests an undesirable similarity: an offer that smacks of bribery. Both words tend to relate a single example to a larger category of things which it resembles, however distantly.

相似性表明一件事物与另一件事物之间只有一种几乎难以捉摸的相似性。因此，相似性所暗示的相似性甚至比近似性和方法性所暗示的还要少：一部小说带有模仿乔伊斯的微弱尝试；一座北方港口，其粉刷过的房屋和铺着瓦片的屋顶却带有地中海的味道。虽然相似性可以同样暗示有利或不利的相似性，但更刺鼻和口语化的相似性几乎只暗示一种不受欢迎的相似性：一种带有贿赂味道的提议。这两个词都倾向于将一个例子与它所相似的更大类别的事物联系起来，无论它们之间的相似性有多远。

4.168 Compel
These words all denote the urging or driving of a person to do something or the obtaining of the performance of some action, all by the use of irresistible physical or moral force. Compel may have as its agent a person, an impersonal entity, a law, an action or a set of conditions, and its object may be a person or an action. A parent may compel his child to do his lessons by threatening to suspend his allowance; the government compels young men to perform military service; the law compels one to report one’s income on pain of penalty; an attack compels one to defend oneself; a recession may compel an employer to lay off many of his employees; the government may take steps to compel compliance with the law.

这些词都表示敦促或驱使某人做某事或迫使某人执行某项行动，所有这些都是通过不可抗拒的物理或道德力量来实现的。强迫的对象可以是人、非个人的实体、法律、行动或一组条件，其客体可以是人或行动。父母可以用暂停零花钱的威胁来强迫孩子学习；政府强迫年轻人服兵役；法律强迫人们上报收入，否则将受到处罚；袭击迫使人们进行自卫；经济衰退可能迫使雇主解雇大量员工；政府可以采取措施强制人们遵守法律。

Force suggests an actual physical process, the use of power, energy or strength to accomplish something or to subdue resistance: to force a confession out of someone; to force the enemy back; to force a lock; to force someone to change an opinion; to force a smile. Coerce can imply the actual use of force but very often suggests its potential in an attempt to secure the surrender of the will: A child may be coerced into obedience by physical punishment or by the threat of it.

Force 指的是实际的物理过程，即使用权力、能量或力量来完成某件事或压制抵抗：逼迫某人认罪；逼退敌人；强行开锁；强迫某人改变观点；强迫微笑。 Coerce 可以指实际使用武力，但更常见的是暗示其潜在目的是试图确保意志的屈服：孩子可能会被体罚或体罚威胁而被迫服从。

Constrain has connotations of repression, restriction, confinement or limitation. It means to compel, but often suggests that the action being prompted or urged is in a negative direction or at least away from that which one may consider positive or pleasant: a man who was constrained by his weak heart to give up all forms of strenuous exercise.

Constrain 有压制、限制、禁锢或约束的含义。它的意思是强迫，但通常暗示所促使或敦促的行为是朝着消极的方向，或至少是远离人们可能认为积极或愉快的方向：一个人因心脏虚弱而被迫放弃所有形式的剧烈运动。

To necessitate and to oblige, as here considered, mean to make an action necessary by the imposition of conditions that must be reacted to. There is often a suggestion of urgency about these words. [Reduction of income necessitates a curtailment of spending; Courtesy obliges a man to respond to an invitation.]

此处所指的“迫使”和“应允”是指通过施加必须作出反应的条件使某项行动成为必要。这些词常常带有紧迫感。[收入减少必然导致支出减少；礼貌迫使一个人回应邀请。]

4.169 Compete
These words refer to two or more people or factions struggling against each other to win a given objective. Compete is the most general of these, applying to the widest range of situations: pianists competing in the contest; football teams competing for the premiership; candidates competing for the office; armies competing for victory in the battle; businesses competing for the biggest slice of the market. As can be seen, the objective implied by this word can be, most concretely, a prize or award that is won by a single confrontation, or, more abstractly, a share in something that falls to one side for its continuing effort: television programmes competing for the largest share of the audience.

这些词语指的是两个或多个人或派系为了实现既定目标而相互竞争。竞争是这些词语中最普遍的，适用于最广泛的情况：钢琴家在比赛中竞争；足球队争夺总理职位；候选人争夺职位；军队在战斗中争夺胜利；企业争夺最大的市场份额。可以看出，这个词所暗示的目标可以最具体地是通过一次对抗赢得的奖品或奖励，或者更抽象地，可以是某物的一部分，但该物因持续努力而落败：电视节目争夺最大的观众份额。

Contend and vie suggest, more strictly, the moment of direct confrontation, and thus are narrowed to one possibility for compete. Contend, however, adds a note of actual hostility or serious disagreement, where compete may suggest none; furthermore, the word often suggests a dispute carried on verbally, as in a debate: speakers who fell to contending about the least important points in the proposal. Even when the verbal implication is not present, the animus often remains: forces contending bitterly to win the uncommitted delegates. The implications of vie stress a series of countering manoeuvres in an ongoing struggle: neighbours continually vying with each other as to who could display the greater number of status symbols. The word is, however, more like compete than contend in lacking overtones of hostility.

Contend 和 vie 更严格地表示直接对抗的时刻，因此仅限于 compete 的一种可能性。但是，Contend 增加了实际敌意或严重分歧的音调，而 compete 可能不表示任何敌意或分歧；此外，这个词通常表示口头进行的争论，如辩论：发言者开始就提案中最不重要的几点争论不休。即使没有口头暗示，敌意往往仍然存在：各方势力激烈争夺尚未表态的代表。vie 的含义强调在持续的斗争中采取一系列反击策略：邻国不断相互竞争，看谁能展示更多的地位象征。但是，这个词更像是 compete 而不是 conend，缺乏敌意的意味。

Oppose may often, by implication, restrict the competing ides to two: extroversion, as opposed to introversion; pre-selection ballots in which may compete for the right to oppose the other party’s choice in the main election. This narrowing of sides to tow is not always present in the word: a debate in which many factions opposed one another. In any case, oppose does stress the choosing of clearly defined sides and suggests a greater rigidity of position than any of these words. It may suggest hostility, like contend, or at least a serious discrepancy of views not easily compromised: attitudes towards drug addiction that were sharply opposed to each other. Rival can be specifically used to suggest a struggle of two or more sides to outdo each other: candidates who rival each other in popularity; dresses that rival each other in vulgarity. Even more specifically, the word may suggest that one performance nearly matches another: domestic wines that rival the best French imports; a role in which she rivals the best acting she has previously shown us. These special applications of the word, in this context, make it the most restricted in meaning of words grouped here.

Oppose 可能经常会暗示将竞争的思想限制为两种：外向与内向相对；预选投票中，人们可能争夺在主要选举中反对另一方选择的权利。这种将双方缩小到两方的局面并不总是出现在这个词中：一场许多派系相互对立的辩论。无论如何，oppose 确实强调选择明确界定的阵营，并且比这些词中的任何一个都更能表明立场的僵化。它可能暗示敌意，如 contend，或者至少暗示观点的严重分歧，不容易妥协：对吸毒的态度是尖锐对立的。Rival 可以专门用来表示两方或多方为超越对方而展开的斗争：候选人在受欢迎程度上相互竞争；着装在粗俗程度上相互竞争。更具体地说，这个词可能暗示一种表现几乎可以与另一种表现相媲美：国产葡萄酒可以与最好的法国进口葡萄酒相媲美；她扮演的角色可以与她之前向我们展示的最佳表演相媲美。在这个语境中，该词的这些特殊应用使其成为这里分组的词中含义最受限制的。

4.170 Competent
These words are applied to persons who exhibit more than average acquired or native skill in the performance of some act or operation. Competent attributes to the subject the ability to carry out the requirements of a specific task. By implication, the completed task is one that can be rated objectively as being either satisfactory or unsatisfactory: No competent tax accountant could possibly have made such egregious errors in making out your return. Thus, while competent can suggest expertise in a complicated field, adequacy rather than excellence may be indicated by the word. A performing artist, for example, might be insulted if described by this word: competent piano-playing that nevertheless lacked inspiration and nuance.	

这些词语适用于在执行某项行为或操作时表现出高于平均水平的后天或天生技能的人。胜任是指主体有能力完成特定任务的要求。言下之意，完成的任务可以客观地评为满意或不满意：没有一个胜任的税务会计师可能在为您报税时犯下如此严重的错误。因此，虽然胜任可以表示在复杂领域的专业知识，但这个词可能表示足够而不是优秀。例如，如果用这个词来描述一位表演艺术家，他可能会觉得受到了侮辱：熟练的钢琴演奏，但缺乏灵感和细微差别。

Able and capable at their most neutral may indicate the practicable or possible: an infant barely able to walk. Capable is stronger here in indicating potential, possibly unsuspected, whether for good or ill: a husband capable of more tenderness than his wife had ever allowed him to express; totalitarian governments capable of the most unspeakable enormities. Where the words approach competent in referring to above-average skill, able suggests versatility and resourcefulness and capable a practical, problem-solving approach: an able architect; a capable stenographer. Capable stresses trained proficiency for a specific task, whereas able suggests a wider perspective or potential: capable lawyers, well-schooled in the intricacies of company law; able children, eager for knowledge, though thwarted by a lack of training in the fundamentals of reading. Also, capable can be applied to things as well as animals: an electronic computer capable of storing millions of bits of information; a shipyard capable of producing two nuclear submarines a month. Able, on the other hand, applies only to creatures capable of performing an action.

Able 和 competent 在最中性的情况下可能表示可行或可能：刚刚不会走路的婴儿。Capable 在这里更强烈地表示潜力，可能是未被察觉的，无论是好是坏：丈夫能够比妻子允许他表达的更多温柔；极权政府能够犯下最无法形容的暴行。当这些词接近 competence 时，指的是高于平均水平的技能，able 暗示多才多艺和足智多谋，able 暗示务实的解决问题的方法：一位能干的建筑师；一位能干的速记员。Capable 强调对某项具体任务的训练熟练程度，而 able 暗示更广阔的视角或潜力：capable 律师，精通公司法的复杂性；able 孩子，渴望获得知识，但由于缺乏阅读基础的训练而受阻。此外，capable 既可以用于动物，也可以用于事物：能够存储数百万比特信息的电子计算机；每月能够生产两艘核潜艇的造船厂。另一方面，Able 仅适用于能够执行某项动作的生物。

Qualified stresses the possession of required skills and is generally applied to professions or trades for which a minimum of schooling or training is required. A qualified teacher has completed the academic training prescribed, but is not necessarily competent.

合格强调拥有所需的技能，通常适用于需要最低限度的学校教育或培训的专业或行业。合格教师已完成规定的学术培训，但不一定胜任。

Efficient adds to competent the idea of a skill in making the most of the time and material available. A mechanic who is competent and efficient will perform a repair job more quickly and cheaply than a mechanic who is merely competent.

高效是胜任的补充，指的是充分利用时间和材料的技能。胜任且高效的技工比仅仅胜任的技工更快、更便宜地完成维修工作。

Fit and good are general words often used in place of the other words in this list. Fit is usually used predicatively: the manager is not fit for his position (meaning not qualified, not competent, not efficient). The specific meaning of good, when used in this sense, is indicated by the context. A good teacher is both qualified and competent; a good manager is both competent and efficient.

Fit 和 good 是常用词，经常用来代替此列表中的其他词。Fit 通常用作表语：经理不适合担任其职位（意思是不合格、不称职、效率低下）。good 的具体含义在用作表语时由上下文决定。一位好老师既称职又称职；一位好经理既称职又高效。

4.171 Complain
These words refer to the action of finding fault with one’s circumstances. Complain is the most general and also the most neutral of these, suggesting either justified or unjustified dissatisfaction with one’s situation: They complained about the terrible brutality with which they were treated; complaining about imaginary slights from the neighbours. Bewail was once similar to complain in its neutrality, but its archaic flavour now makes it suitable only for the unsympathetic satire of complaining that is motivated by self-pity, especially when the subject is a woman: like a tedious Puccini heroine bewailing her sad fate. Grumble suggests an habitual ill-humour, especially of a man, that does not quite expect to be taken seriously: husbands who grumble every summer as they dutifully pack the car for the family holiday; prisoners grumbling over the poor quality of institutional food. Whine implies a high-pitched, self-pitying tone, often sued for a continually complaining or nagging woman or for a petulant child; its use suggests complete lack of sympathy for the subject: The patient whined on and on about how unfairly her psychoanalyst had treated her. If applied to a man, it suggests weak or cowardly behaviour: he whined about his bad luck while others put out the fire.

这些词指的是对自己的处境吹毛求疵的行为。抱怨是这些词中最普遍也是最中性的，表明对自己的处境的不满是合理或不合理的：他们抱怨自己受到的可怕残酷对待；抱怨邻居们想象中的怠慢。哀号曾经与抱怨在中立性上相似，但它的古老风格现在使它只适合用于由自怜引起的无情讽刺抱怨，尤其是当主题是女性时：就像普契尼笔下乏味的女主角哀叹她悲惨的命运。牢骚指的是习惯性的坏脾气，尤其是男人的坏脾气，并不指望被认真对待：丈夫每年夏天在为家庭度假尽职尽责地收拾行李时都会抱怨；囚犯抱怨机构食物质量差。呜咽意味着一种尖锐的、自怜的语调，通常用于不断抱怨或唠叨的女人或任性的孩子；它的用法表明对治疗对象完全缺乏同情：病人不停地抱怨她的心理分析师对她有多不公平。如果用在男人身上，则表明他软弱或胆怯：当其他人救火时，他却抱怨自己的坏运气。

The rest of these words range from the extremely informal to slang. They also range, in the order of their discussion, towards less and less sympathy for the subject. Gripe can be used for any fruitless expression of dissatisfaction, but is especially pertinent to military life: The officers were told to beware of soldiers who have nothing to gripe about. This context has emphasized the word as a normal everyday complaining about trivial things; it would not be used for outraged indignation or even serious dissatisfaction. Whinge is much more common than whine or gripe for continual petty expression of dissatisfaction: always whingeing about not getting a fair go; farmers who whinged about too much rain when they weren’t whingeing about too little. Grouse implies a greater animus than gripe or whinge and may suggest a more pointed lashing out in accusation or insult: grousing about the food only when the cook could overhear them. Beef works as an intensification of gripe but does not necessarily suggest the bitterness of grouse; it can suggest an unjustified complaining: They beefed about mistreatment only to get front-page treatment in the newspapers. Bellyache suggests complaining that is interminable, tiresome and completely without justification: continually bellyaching no matter how his room-mates tried to shut him up. The slang word bitch is extremely general in its reference to complaining; it can range in application from the fruitless dissatisfaction indicated by gripe to the bitterness of grouse: He bitched about the weather, the food and anything else that crossed his mind; The bitched about the favouritism the teacher showed to the daughter of the headmistress.

其余这些词的范围从非常不正式的到俚语。它们也随着讨论的顺序而变得越来越不同情这个话题。Gripe 可以用于任何毫无结果的不满表达，但尤其适用于军队生活：军官们被告知要提防那些没有什么可抱怨的士兵。这种语境强调了这个词是日常对琐碎事情的抱怨；它不会用于愤怒的愤慨甚至严重的不满。Whinge 比 whine 或 gripe 更常用于表达持续的琐碎不满：总是抱怨没有得到公平的待遇；农民抱怨雨水太多，而不是抱怨雨水太少。Grouse 比 gripe 或 whinge 暗示了更大的敌意，可能暗示更尖锐的指责或侮辱：只有当厨师能听到时才抱怨食物。 Beef 可以强化 gripe，但并不一定表示 grouse 的苦涩；它可以表示无理的抱怨：他们抱怨受到的虐待，结果却上了报纸头版。Bellyache 表示抱怨没完没了、令人厌烦且毫无道理：不管室友如何劝他闭嘴，他都不停地抱怨。俚语 bitch 非常笼统地指抱怨；它的应用范围很广，从 gripe 表示的毫无结果的不满到 grouse 的苦涩：他抱怨天气、食物以及他想到的任何其他事情；那个人抱怨老师偏袒女校长的女儿。

4.172 Comliant
These words refer to a pleasant or tolerant manner, open to other people’s demands or desires. Compliant suggests a passive nature readily moulded to conform to the wishes of others, one easily persuaded with little effort: meekly compliant to even his harshest expectations. Suggestible is a less formal word for the same idea, but it has an additional implication indicating a naïve or unguarded sensibility that can be influenced even by subtle or indirect methods: The disapproved of showing such violence-ridden films to suggestible children.

这些词指的是一种愉快或宽容的态度，对别人的要求或愿望持开放态度。Compliant 指的是一种被动的天性，很容易被塑造成顺从他人的愿望，一个人很容易被说服，几乎不用费什么力气：即使对他最苛刻的期望也温顺地顺从。Suggestible 是一个不太正式的词，表达了同样的意思，但它还有一个额外的含义，表示一种天真或不设防的敏感性，即使是通过微妙或间接的方法也能影响它：他们不赞成向易受暗示影响的儿童放映此类充斥暴力的电影。

Willing stresses a more conscious decision to do something and does not, unlike compliant or suggestible, suggest an innately weak or conforming nature: informing her that he would be willing to run the errand for her; willing, eager students. On the other hand, obliging refers not to a conscious choice but to a nature that is cheerfully ready to assist or that will permit someone else to satisfy a wish: an obliging stewardess; teenage girls who feel they must be obliging on dates or become unpopular. Agreeable stresses the cheerful side of obliging: an agreeable personality. It may also suggest anything that is simply pleasurable: an agreeable climate. But the word, in another use, can suggest an even more willing and open attitude than obliging: finding that she was agreeable to anything he suggested. Accommodating refers to people who are willing, obliging or agreeable in the sense of preparedness to do or supply what is wanted: In our search for local historical material the storekeeper was most accommodating.

愿意强调更有意识地决定做某事，与顺从或易受暗示不同，它并不表示天生软弱或顺从的天性：告诉她他愿意为她跑腿；愿意、热切的学生。另一方面，乐于助人指的不是有意识的选择，而是指乐于助人或允许他人满足愿望的天性：乐于助人的空姐；十几岁的女孩觉得在约会时必须乐于助人，否则就会不受欢迎。和蔼可亲强调乐于助人的快乐一面：和蔼可亲的个性。它也可能表示任何令人愉快的事物：宜人的气候。但是，这个词在另一种用法中，可以表示比乐于助人更愿意和更开放的态度：发现她同意他提出的任何建议。通情达理指愿意、乐于助人或和蔼可亲的人，意思是愿意做或提供所需的东西：在我们寻找当地历史资料时，店主是最乐于助人的。

Complaisant in one of its uses is simply a more formal term for agreeable or obliging, but with a greater stress on the conforming character suggested by complaint: her complaisant eagerness to please. The word has a special use, however, to suggest a cheerful or hypocritical indifference to strict moral standards, either in others or oneself: parents who are permissive and complaisant about their children’s behaviour. Broad-minded is in some ways a more informal substitute for complaisant in this context; it suggests a lax regard for moral standards, although it does not necessarily imply a cheerful attitude. In other contexts the word might suggest an admirable ability to see all sides of a question. Here, by contrast, it suggests, almost euphemistically, an ability to accept the misbehaviour of others without protest: parties that put a strain on the most broad-minded of her older friends.

Complaisant 的一种用法仅仅是表示和蔼可亲或乐于助人的更正式的术语，但更强调 complaint 所暗示的顺从性格：她那种讨人喜欢的、讨人喜欢的、讨人喜欢的热情。然而，这个词还有一种特殊的用法，表示对他人或自己的严格道德标准表现出一种愉快或虚伪的漠不关心：父母对孩子的行为宽容而顺从。Broad-minded 在某种程度上是 complaisant 的非正式替代词，在这种情况下，它表示对道德标准的宽松尊重，尽管它并不一定意味着愉快的态度。在其他情况下，这个词可能表示一种令人钦佩的全面看待问题的能力。相比之下，在这里，它几乎委婉地表示一种不抗议地接受他人不当行为的能力：给她最宽容的老朋友带来压力的聚会。

4.173 Component
These words all refer to parts of a whole. Component refers to a part that functions in association with other parts but that can easily be detached from them; this is in contrast to an organic whole in which the parts are fused or have lost their individual identity within the larger entity. In choosing hi-fi equipment, for example, one can buy separate component, such as speakers, turntable and amplifier, and wire them together oneself. Or one can buy a pre-packaged console, designed as a single unit. The word can suggest a more intimate relationship, as in chemistry, where it refers to a substance that in varying degrees is present in a mixture without being chemically integrated into it; in this case, a change in appearance or apparent loss of identity may be indicated: Salt is a component of sea water. Ingredient is a more general word, referring equally well to the unaltered substances mixed together in an amorphous mass and to the fused or transformed parts of an entity or organic whole: Turmeric is an ingredient of curry powder; a novel that contains all the ingredients of good mystery story.

这些词都指整体的各部分。组件指与其他部分协同工作但又很容易从其他部分分离的部分；这与有机整体形成对比，在有机整体中，各部分融合在一起或失去其在较大实体中的个体身份。例如，在选择高保真设备时，人们可以购买单独的组件，如扬声器、转盘和放大器，然后自己将它们连接在一起。或者，人们可以购买预先包装好的控制台，设计为一个单元。这个词可以表示更密切的关系，例如在化学中，它指的是以不同程度存在于混合物中但未化学整合的物质；在这种情况下，可能表示外观发生变化或身份明显丧失：盐是海水的成分。成分是一个更通用的词，同样指混合在一起形成无定形团块的未改变物质以及实体或有机整体的融合或转化部分：姜黄是咖喱粉的成分；一部小说包含了优秀悬疑故事的所有成分。

Element and constituent both refer more strictly to essential, necessary or intrinsic parts of a whole. Element comes from a Latin root meaning first principal; this is reflected in its use to indicate the rudiments of a subject: the elements of good writing. As in this example, the word’s stress is often on simple or basic parts of a more complex whole. In chemistry, the word refers to those basic substances, such as oxygen, mercury and copper, that are irreducible by ordinary chemical mans and that are the building blocks of all matter. Constituent refers more generally to a part that is necessary to the functioning of a whole. Such a part often loses it individual identity completely in contributing to the new entity; conversely, withdrawing it from the whole would drastically change the larger entity: The element hydrogen is a constituent of water.

元素和成分都更严格地指整体的基本、必要或固有部分。元素来自拉丁语词根，意为第一要素；这反映在其用来表示一门学科的基本知识：优秀写作的要素。如在本例中，这个词的重音通常放在更复杂整体的简单或基本部分上。在化学中，这个词指的是那些基本物质，例如氧、汞和铜，它们是普通化学家用来还原的，是所有物质的组成部分。成分更一般地指整体运作所必需的部分。这样的部分往往会在对新实体做出贡献时完全失去其个体身份；相反，将其从整体中撤出将彻底改变更大的实体：氢元素是水的成分。

4.174 Composition
These words refer to pieces of non-fiction writing. Composition、 indicates a formal work that is planned in advance rather than improvisatory in character. It is used to refer any sort of writing assignment in school, often on a set subject, with an emphasis on grammar and style rather than on research or factual presentation: The teacher asked them to describe their summer holidays in the class composition. Exercise is a less formal word and is restricted in reference to such an assigned piece of writing in school. The word emphasizes organization round a single topic, may suggest briefer treatment, and is even less likely than composition to require factual research: a class exercise of three hundred words. Theme is sometimes used in a similar sense, but this word’s main function is to refer to the dominant idea of any piece of writing: the theme of alienation in his study of middle-class culture.
	
这些词指的是非虚构作品。Composition、 表示事先计划好的正式作品，而非即兴创作。它用于指学校里的任何写作作业，通常针对固定主题，注重语法和风格而不是研究或事实陈述：老师要求他们在课堂作文中描述他们的暑假。Exercise 是一个不太正式的词，仅指学校指定的这种写作作品。这个词强调围绕单一主题的组织，可能建议更简短的处理，甚至比 Composition 更不需要事实研究：一项三百字的课堂练习。Theme 有时以类似的意义使用，但这个词的主要功能是指任何作品的主导思想：他对中产阶级文化研究中的异化主题。

Essay is a much more general word than those above. While it may be used in place of any of them to refer to a writing assignment in school, the word more widely indicates any sort of non-fiction writing shorter than book-length, whether scholarly, humorous, propagandist or reflective. The word, moreover, may suggest any approach from the extremely informal and personal to the solemn, stately or stylized: the refreshing irreverence of Addis’s chatty essays; the Ciceronian elegance that Carlyle attempted in his early essays; howlingly funny about the perils of suburban living. Article is restricted to any piece of non-fiction that has appeared in a newspaper, magazine or journal; it ranges in reference from the briefest and most utilitarian news release through all the possibilities inherent in essay, including the more abstruse scholarly or scientific study: an article giving up-to-the-minute election returns; an article treating the effects of radiation on arthropods.

散文比上述单词更通用。虽然它可以代替上述单词中的任何一个来指代学校的写作作业，但这个词更广泛地表示任何短于书本长度的非小说写作，无论是学术性的、幽默性的、宣传性的还是反思性的。此外，这个词可能表示从极其非正式和个人化到庄严、庄重或风格化的任何方法：阿迪斯闲聊散文中令人耳目一新的不敬；卡莱尔在早期散文中试图表现出的西塞罗式的优雅；关于郊区生活危险的极其有趣的描述。文章仅限于任何出现在报纸、杂志或期刊上的非小说作品；它的范围从最简短和最实用的新闻稿到散文中固有的所有可能性，包括更深奥的学术或科学研究：一篇提供最新选举结果的文章；一篇讨论辐射对节肢动物影响的文章。

Paper has two areas of relevance. One relates to composition or exercise in referring to a written assignment for a school class or to a tutorial exercise for a university group. [His paper was well received by the class.] In this use, the word may suggest any sort of approach, from a demonstration of writing ability to the presentation of factual research. The word’s other use refers to a scholarly essay read to one’s colleagues or to a scholarly article published in a learned journal: a paper on disturbances in the earth’s magnetic field. Treatise indicates an exclusively scholarly context, referring to any presentation from essay- to book-length in which conclusions are drawn from a body of data in a formal and systematic way: a treatise on the development of the Gregorian chant.

论文有两个相关领域。一个与写作或练习有关，指的是学校课堂的书面作业或大学小组的辅导练习。[他的论文受到了全班同学的好评。] 在这种用法中，这个词可能表示任何类型的方法，从写作能力的展示到事实研究的展示。这个词的另一个用法是指向同事朗读的学术论文或发表在学术期刊上的学术文章：一篇关于地球磁场扰动的论文。论文表示一种纯粹的学术背景，指的是从论文到书籍长度的任何展示，其中以正式和系统的方式从一组数据中得出结论：一篇关于格里高利圣咏发展的论文。

The remaining pair of words also is restricted to a scholarly or academic context. Thesis may suggest briefer or less exhaustive treatment that treatise, pointing to the establishing and defending of a principle: a thesis in which he corroborates Keynes’s theory of deficit spending. Like theme, thesis may also refer to the dominant idea of contention of a piece of writing, although it pertains mainly to argumentative non-fiction: a collection of essays each of which illustrates his thesis that modern novelists are unable to create memorable women characters. Most concretely, thesis refers to the extended paper, possibly of book-length, that is sometimes required of candidates for a Master’s degree and always for a Ph.D. degree. Dissertation is the most formal of these words and, when used instead of thesis, suggests the most formal sort of writing as well. It may refer to any reasoned treatment, like treatise, but most concretely it indicates such a work, usually of book-length, when it is a requirement for a Ph.D. or other doctoral degree: a dissertation analyzing cold-war strategies. The word may sometimes be used pejoratively for any long-winded and pompous piece of exposition; giving us another dreary dissertation on the evils of imperialism.

剩下的两个词也仅限于学术或学术背景。论文可能比论文更简短或更不详尽的处理，指向建立和捍卫一个原则：他在论文中证实了凯恩斯的赤字支出理论。与主题一样，论文也可能指一篇文章的主导论点，尽管它主要涉及议论文：一系列散文，每一篇都说明了他的论点，即现代小说家无法创造令人难忘的女性角色。最具体地说，论文是指扩展的论文，可能是一本书的长度，有时是硕士学位候选人的要求，而博士学位候选人则总是要求。论文是这些词中最正式的，当用来代替论文时，也表明最正式的写作类型。它可以指任何有理有据的处理，如论文，但最具体地说，它表示这样的作品，通常是一本书的长度，当它是博士学位的要求时。或其他博士学位：分析冷战战略的论文。这个词有时可能被贬义为任何冗长而浮夸的论述；给我们另一篇关于帝国主义罪恶的沉闷论文。

4.175 Compulsory
These words describe actions that are judged to be inescapably necessary. Compulsory suggests that someone in authority has imposed a course of action that may not be departed from compulsory attendance of classes. It may further suggest that the compulsory ruling will be enforcing, by coercion if necessary, and that violators will be punished: compulsory blacklisting. Mandatory is like compulsory in suggesting an imposed rule: mandatory silence in the library. In contrast, it is milder than compulsory in that it stops short of suggesting coercion and punishment as methods of enforcing the ruling.

这些词语描述了被判定为不可避免地必要的行为。强制性表明权威人士强加了一系列行动，这些行动不能偏离强制上课的规定。它还可能表明强制裁决将强制执行，必要时将使用胁迫手段，违反者将受到惩罚：强制列入黑名单。强制性与强制性一样，都表明了强加的规则：图书馆内强制保持安静。相比之下，强制性比强制性更温和，因为它没有暗示强制和惩罚是执行裁决的方法。

Binding also describes a ruling handed down by an authority, but it may specifically suggest a one-time decision concerning a specific dispute between two parties who agree beforehand to abide by the results: binding arbitration. It may also suggest that earlier, more tentative rulings have been submitted to a final authority. [The teacher’s compulsory ruling against wearing Bermuda shorts to class was referred to the principal, whose decision would be binding.]

约束性也指由权威机构做出的裁决，但它可能特别指针对双方事先同意遵守结果的特定争议做出的一次性决定：约束性仲裁。它也可能指早些时候，更临时的裁决已提交给最终权威机构。[老师禁止穿百慕大短裤上课的强制性裁决已提交给校长，校长的决定具有约束力。]

Obligatory is like binding in its legal sense. In a more general use, however, it suggests something expected or made necessary by morality or conscience, rather than by a higher authority as in the previous words: the obligatory chaperone at teenage parties. As such, its force is more what should be done than what is or must be done: attendance at tutorial classes is obligatory. Imperative refers to a necessity dictated by circumstance rather than by an authority or a code of morality: imperative to get food and water before sundown. If used to refer to an imposed rule, it is more like mandatory than compulsory.

义务在法律意义上类似于约束。然而，在更普遍的用法中，它表示道德或良知所期望或必须做的事情，而不是像前面的单词那样由更高的权威所要求或必须做的事情：青少年聚会上的义务监护人。因此，其效力更多的是应该做的事情，而不是必须做的事情：参加辅导班是义务。命令是指由环境而不是权威或道德准则决定的必要性：日落前必须获得食物和水。如果用来指强加的规则，它更像是强制性的而不是强制性的。

De rigueur is close to obligatory, but is milder in referring to those acts or observance considered necessary according to etiquette or required by good form; it usually appears only as a predicate adjective: an unwritten rule that made evening dress de rigueur for attending her soirées.

De rigueur 接近于义务，但在指代礼仪所认为必要或良好形式所要求的行为或遵守时，其语气较为温和；它通常只作为谓语形容词出现：一条不成文的规定，规定晚礼服是参加晚会的必需品。

4.176 Conceited
These words refer to a person who is afflicted with unwarranted self-admiration or a feeling of his own superiority. Conceited pertains to an excessive affection for oneself that may be revealed by an uncritical smugness and aloofness from others: conceited girls who walk home from school with their noses in the air. More specifically, the word may point to a person who becomes well-headed because of a particular accomplishment or occurrence, often a trivial one: She became unbearably conceited after the football captain asked her out. Vain suggests a person who is extremely concerned about his personal appearance or the impression he makes on others. A conceited person might feel that his superiority is self-evident, whereas a vain person would more likely strive constantly to impress others or improve his appearance: The typical dandy of old was so vain about his appearance that he spent almost as much time primping before a mirror as his female counterpart.

这些词指的是被不合理的自我崇拜或自以为是所困扰的人。自负是指对自己的过度喜爱，这种喜爱可能表现为不加批判的自鸣得意和对他人漠不关心：自负的女孩们昂首阔步地从学校走回家。更具体地说，这个词可能指的是因为某项成就或事件（通常是微不足道的成就或事件）而变得自以为是的人：在足球队长约她出去之后，她变得自负得令人难以忍受。虚荣指的是极度关心自己外表或给别人留下的印象的人。自负的人可能觉得自己的优越性是不言而喻的，而虚荣的人则更有可能不断努力给别人留下深刻印象或改善自己的外表：典型的老花花公子对自己的外表非常自负，以至于他花在镜子前打扮的时间几乎和他的女伴一样多。

Egotistical need not suggest an outward show, like vain, so much as an extreme self-preoccupation and lack of interest in the feelings or affairs of others. On the other hand, where conceited usually suggests that someone is self-admiring for clearly defined reasons, however specious, egotistical may suggest a more unconscious, narcissistic habit of mind: an egotistical snob who thought the world began and ended where he lived. Sometimes, however, the word can point to the habit of calling attention to oneself and one’s accomplishments, while ignoring the interests of others: the egotistical artist who monopolized the conversation with talk of his work in progress.

自负不一定意味着一种外在的表现，如虚荣，而是一种极端的自我中心主义，对他人感受或事务缺乏兴趣。另一方面，自负通常意味着某人出于明确的理由而自恋，无论理由多么似是而非，而自负可能意味着一种更无意识的自恋习惯：一个自负的势利小人，认为世界从他居住的地方开始和结束。然而，有时，这个词可以指一种习惯，即把注意力集中在自己和自己的成就上，而忽视他人的利益：一个自负的艺术家，用他正在进行的工作的谈论垄断了谈话。

Boastful and vainglorious concentrate on this last possibility of egotistical, both referring to self-praise and attention-seeking in public. Boastful emphasizes unsubtle and even boorish public displays of vocal self-approval: after a few drinks, he always became boastful about his wartime activities. Vainglorious focuses more exclusively on hollow show, boastful self-praise, but conspicuous displays of status symbols are often involves: vainglorious dowagers dripping minks and diamonds.

Boastful 和 vainglorious 集中于自负的最后可能性，两者都指在公共场合自我吹嘘和寻求关注。Boastful 强调公开地、毫不掩饰地甚至粗鲁地展示自己的口头自我认可：喝了几杯酒后，他总是吹嘘自己的战时活动。Vainglorious 更专注于空洞的炫耀、自吹自擂，但经常涉及炫耀地位象征：虚荣的贵妇身上挂满了貂皮和钻石。

Proud can, of cause, indicate legitimate satisfaction at accomplishing a goal or honour: proud of his high marks in the examination. It can also apply to things invested with real dignity: a proud history; proud mountains silhouetted in the sunset. When the word takes on a disapproving tone, it suggests a stiff-necked and unrealistic lack of humility: too proud to admit that he had been grossly in error.

当然，骄傲可以表示实现目标或荣誉后感到的正当满足：为自己在考试中取得的高分感到自豪。它也可以用于形容具有真正尊严的事物：令人骄傲的历史；夕阳下映衬的令人骄傲的山脉。当这个词带有不赞同的语气时，它表明一个人固执己见，不切实际，缺乏谦逊：太骄傲了，不愿承认自己犯了严重错误。

4.177 Conclusive
These words are concerned with those moments in a sequence of events that are crucial to bringing about a given result. Conclusive suggests a final act that settles questions at issue in a previous course of action: the atomic-bombing of Hiroshima as the conclusive event of World War II. The word may be used in another sense to refer, not to the events themselves, but to a later analysis of them. In this sense, conclusive refers to an incontrovertible interpretation of these events as a whole: conclusive proof that Richard II was not the villain Shakespeare made him out to be. A decisive event differs from a conclusive event in that it need not necessarily be the last one in a given sequence. Indeed, it may be a situation present almost at the outset, with the whole following course of action merely corroborating it. [The enemy’s lack of inspired leadership was decisive to its defeat, long before a single shot was fired.]

这些词语与一系列事件中对实现特定结果至关重要的时刻有关。决定性事件是指解决先前行动过程中存在争议的问题的最后一项行动：广岛原子弹爆炸是第二次世界大战的决定性事件。这个词也可以用在另一种意义上，指的不是事件本身，而是对它们的后续分析。在这个意义上，决定性事件是指对这些事件整体的无可辩驳的解释：确凿的证据证明理查二世不是莎士比亚笔下的恶棍。决定性事件与决定性事件的不同之处在于，它不一定是给定序列中的最后一个事件。事实上，它可能是一种几乎在一开始就存在的情况，而整个后续行动只是证实了这一点。[敌人缺乏鼓舞人心的领导是其失败的决定性因素，早在开枪之前。]

Determining, like decisive, may refer to something that comes early or late in a course of action. Decisive may be more suitable in describe underlying factors that are inherent in a situation and prejudice the outcome. [No matter how many decisive victories Justinian won, the split of East and West into two alien cultures was the determining factor in his ultimate failure to re-unite the Roman Empire.]

决定性，就像决定性一样，可能指在行动过程中出现得早或晚的事情。决定性可能更适合描述情况中固有的、影响结果的潜在因素。[无论查士丁尼赢得了多少决定性的胜利，东西方分裂为两种异质文化是他最终未能重新统一罗马帝国的决定性因素。]

Definitive, when referring to an act, combines the meanings of both conclusive and decisive. It applies when a sequence of events has been in doubt until the very last act, which irrevocably settles things: Elizabeth’s definitive victory over the Armada settled the question of British naval superiority for centuries. When the word refers to a later analysis of event, it takes in all that is implied by conclusive in this sense, but adds to it implications of authoritative accuracy and incontestable interpretation not to be surpassed. In this sense, definitive, unlike conclusive, need not suggest the settling of controversy or the proposing of any thesis whatsoever; it simply suggests finality of examination and analysis: the definitive history of the Boer War; the definitive biography of Byron that strips away all myth and conjecture to show us the actual man as he was.

权威性在指代某一行为时，兼具了决定性和决定性的含义。它适用于一系列事件直到最后一幕才确定下来的情况：伊丽莎白对无敌舰队的决定性胜利解决了几个世纪以来英国海军优势的问题。当这个词指代对事件的后续分析时，它包含了权威性所暗示的一切，但还增加了权威准确性和无可争辩的解释的含义，这些含义是不可超越的。在这个意义上，权威性与权威性不同，它不一定意味着争议的解决或任何论点的提出；它只是表明了审查和分析的终结：布尔战争的权威历史；拜伦的权威传记，它剥去了所有的神话和猜测，向我们展示了他真实的一面。

4.178 Condescend
These words refer to the treating of another person as one’s inferior. Condescend suggests particularly the awareness of a social or class distinction, false or real, which one person bridges in dealing or speaking to someone beneath him. The person who condescends, however, calls attention to the difference and does not wish it forgotten. Once, this word was simply descriptive: Her Highness condescends to recognize the foreign ambassador. Nowadays, in our egalitarian world, the word has an almost exclusively negative implication: tourists who condescend to the "natives." Deign emphasizes choice; it implies that one could very well have chosen an opposite, perhaps more appropriate, course. It is not necessarily restricted solely to dealing with one’s inferiors: He didn’t deign to reply to his colleague’s accusation. The word’s extreme formality limits its use today, except for satirical effect: the salesgirl who actually deigned to wait on me.

这些词指的是将他人视为自己的下级。屈尊特别表明一个人意识到了社会或阶级差异，无论是虚假的还是真实的，一个人在与比他低的人打交道或交谈时会弥合这种差异。然而，屈尊的人会让人们注意到这种差异，并且不希望它被遗忘。曾经，这个词只是描述性的：女王陛下屈尊承认外国大使。如今，在我们这个平等的世界里，这个词几乎完全具有负面含义：屈尊对待“当地人”的游客。屈尊强调选择；它意味着一个人完全可以选择相反的、也许更合适的做法。它不一定仅限于与下级打交道：他没有屈尊回应同事的指控。这个词的极端正式性限制了它在今天的使用，除了讽刺效果：实际上屈尊为我服务的女售货员。

Stoop was earlier like condescend in emphasizing social station and like deign in suggesting choice; but it now has uses mostly relating to a discreditable moral act: statesmen who stoop to exchanging political favours. Condescend might suggest a generally grand, arch or pompous behavior; stoop suggests single questionable acts. Unbend is more like condescend on this score, but its overtone is one of approval for a stuffy person who learns to relax or act less officiously. [Why does she have to condescend to me all the time? Can’t she unbend a little and treat me like anyone else?]

以前，stoop 和 condescend 一样强调社会地位，和 deign 一样暗示选择；但现在它的用法主要与不光彩的道德行为有关：屈尊交换政治恩惠的政治家。condescend 可能暗示一种普遍的、傲慢的或自负的行为；stoop 则暗示单一的可疑行为。Unbend 在这一点上更像 condescend，但它的弦外之音是赞同一个学会放松或不那么爱管闲事的古板的人。[她为什么总是要屈尊俯就我？她就不能放开一点，把我当成别人一样对待吗？]

Patronize, even more than condescend, suggests haughtiness of bearing and an overtone of looking down on someone: a teacher who patronized his students by oversimplifying everything he taught them. Tolerate, in this context, has gone through several changes in usage. It has meant and can still mean simply to accept; society women who will tolerate eccentric guests so long as they are artists. The word at one point took on a note of reconciliation: learning to tolerate minority groups. Now this last use is avoided as resembling patronize or condescend too closely: Aboriginess who wish to be accepted, not merely tolerated.

Patronize 比 condescend 更能暗示出傲慢的态度和轻视他人的意味：一位老师通过过度简化他所教的一切来居高临下地对待学生。在这种情况下，Tolerate 的用法经历了几次变化。它曾经意味着并且仍然可以意味着接受；社交女性会容忍古怪的客人，只要他们是艺术家。这个词一度带有和解的意味：学会容忍少数群体。现在人们避免使用最后一种用法，因为它与 patronize 或 condescend 太过相似：希望被接受而不仅仅是被容忍的原住民。

4.179 Confidence
These words refer to a psychological trait that involves a conviction of one’s own worth or an unselfconscious certainty of succeeding at whatever is attempted, unhampered by doubt, hesitation or fear. Confidence stresses a general optimism that all is or will be well: able to face the future with confidence. The word may suggest fearless trust, whether well- or ill-advised: talking to the unsavoury people in the bar with effortless confidence. Self-confidence restricts these possibilities to a general optimism concerning one’s own capacities and accomplishment, suggesting a complete absence of timidity and, less positively, an aggressive bearing: social clubs set up to promote self-confidence in teenagers; a garish costume that matched the self-confidence with which she ploughed her way through the startled guests.

这些词语指的是一种心理特征，包括对自身价值的坚信或对成功无意识的确定，无论尝试什么，都不会受到怀疑、犹豫或恐惧的阻碍。自信强调一种普遍的乐观态度，认为一切都会好起来：能够满怀信心地面对未来。这个词可能表示无所畏惧的信任，无论是明智的还是错误的：在酒吧里毫不费力地自信地与令人讨厌的人交谈。自信将这些可能性限制为对自身能力和成就的普遍乐观，表明完全没有胆怯，以及不那么积极的攻击性举止：为促进青少年自信而设立的社交俱乐部；她在吃惊的客人中艰难前行时所穿的花哨服装与自信相匹配。

Aplomb and self-possession stress the ability to keep oneself under firm control. Self-possession suggests the restraining of conflicting impulses or the brushing aside of distractions, accompanied by a cool unemotional approach even in trying situations: calmly working her way through the customs inspection with unflustered self-possession. Aplomb, by contrast, emphasizes a total lack of self-doubt and may suggest a carefree or uncritical exuberance: Although he had never duelled before, he faced his opponent with aplomb.

泰然自若和镇定自若强调的是能够牢牢控制自己。镇定自若意味着克制冲突的冲动或排除干扰，即使在困难的情况下也能保持冷静、不带感情的态度：镇定自若地通过海关检查。相比之下，泰然自若强调的是完全没有自我怀疑，可能暗示着一种无忧无虑或不加批判的热情：尽管他以前从未决斗过，但他还是泰然自若地面对对手。

Poise stresses steadiness and balance and, somewhat like self-possession, suggests a calm sureness of manner able to cope courteously with any contingency: a shy and awkward adolescent who had turned overnight into a young woman amply endowed with grace and poise. With its emphasis on a mastery of social properties, savoir faire relates closely to poise in stressing an intuitive ability to do the right thing socially and to get on well with other people whatever the situation: a savoir faire that never deserted him whether he found himself among first-nighters at the opera or among the bare-footed habitués of a bohemian coffee shop.

风度强调稳定和平衡，有点像镇定，暗示着一种冷静、自信的态度，能够礼貌地应对任何突发事件：一个害羞、笨拙的青少年一夜之间变成了一个拥有充分的优雅和风度的年轻女子。 处事技巧强调对社交属性的掌握，与风度密切相关，强调一种直觉能力，无论在什么情况下，都能在社交中做正确的事，与他人相处融洽：无论是在歌剧院的首映式观众中，还是在波西米亚咖啡馆赤脚的常客中，他都不会抛弃这种处事技巧。

Self-assurance and smugness stress an extreme conviction of one’s own worth, ability or superiority. Self-assurance can be used either positively or negatively, but smugness is exclusively disapproving: an astonishing self-assurance in whizzing through an exam for which he had spent only a few hours preparing; insisting with unblushing self-assurance that even the stupidest native would understand her English if only she spoke loudly and clearly enough. Smugness suggests an uncritical vanity or pride in one’s own privileged position and a failure to see things from other people’s point of view. This puts it in strong contrast to savoir faire which stresses a sensing of what people will find pleasant and apt: the smugness with which she chose to stay at the most expensive hotels to avoid rubbing shoulders with the "hoi polloi." Cockiness is an informal term for complete confidence in oneself. Unlike self-assurance, the word carries some pejorative connotations and the attitude that it describes is much more in evidence than smugness: His cockiness about his athletic prowess knew no bounds.

自信和自鸣得意强调对自己的价值、能力或优越性的极度自信。自信既可以用作正面词，也可以用作负面词，但自鸣得意完全是反对的意思：她只花了几个小时准备考试，却表现出惊人的自信；她毫不掩饰地坚持认为，只要她说话声音大、语气清晰，即使是最愚蠢的当地人也能听懂她的英语。自鸣得意意味着对自己的特权地位不加批判的虚荣心或骄傲，以及无法从别人的角度看问题。这与处事处事形成鲜明对比，处事处事强调对人们会觉得愉快和合适的事物的感觉：她自鸣得意地选择住在最昂贵的酒店，以避免与“平民百姓”打交道。自大是一个非正式的术语，表示对自己完全有信心。与自信不同，这个词带有一些贬义，它所描述的态度比自鸣得意更为明显：他对自己运动能力的自信毫无止境。

4.180 Confine
These words refer to the shutting up, usually of people, in a particular place. Confine is the most general of these and indicates a reduction of mobility for whatever reason: He felt confined and claustrophobic in a big city; confined by ill-health to her bed. More pertinent to this context, the word suggests removing someone to a prison or mental hospital, usually against the person’s will: a sentence confining him to life imprisonment; a court order confining him indefinitely to an institution for the criminally insane. From one sense of being kept in bed, confine is used (usually in the passive voice) to mean being brought to bed pending the birth of a child: She was confined in the local hospital, awaiting her fifth baby.

这些词指将人关在某个特定的地方。Confine 是这些词中最常用的，表示由于某种原因活动能力的降低：他在大城市里感到局促不安，有幽闭恐惧症；因健康不佳而卧床不起。更切合此语境的是，这个词指将某人送进监狱或精神病院，通常是违背其意愿的：判处其终身监禁的判决；将他无限期关进精神病罪犯收容所的法院命令。从被关在床上的意思来看，confine 被用来（通常用被动语态）表示在孩子出生前被带到床上：她被关在当地医院，等待着她的第五个孩子。

The directness and informality of gaol makes confine sound euphemistic by comparison when it refers to shutting someone up in prison: gaoled on a disorderly-conduct charge. Although identical in meaning to gaol, imprison gives more formal tone without sounding= euphemistic like confine: a régime that imprisoned anyone suspected of dissent. The one possible difference between gaol and imprison is that gaol might be used for a relatively short stay: gaoled overnight because he had trouble raising bail; imprisoned for ten years in the Bastille. Incarcerate is the most formal of all these words; while close in meaning to imprison, it may suggest the initial act of imprisoning: He was incarcerated in the local gaol pending transfer to a maximum-security prison. Incarcerated is sometimes used to suggest a harsh, punitive or brutal imprisoning under inhumane conditions: They incarcerated him in a windowless basement cell. The word, furthermore, can refer like confine to the shutting up of the mentally ill; here the emphasis may be on inhumane treatment: The family incarcerated the wretch in a concealed, airless room in the attic.

相比之下，当 gaol 指的是将某人关进监狱时，其直接性和非正式性使 confine 听起来更加委婉：因扰乱治安罪名被关进监狱。尽管 imprison 的意思与 gaol 相同，但它语气更正式，而听起来又不像 confine 那样委婉：监禁任何涉嫌持不同政见者的政权。gaol 和 imprison 之间一个可能的区别是 gaol 可能用于相对较短的监禁：因为难以筹集保释金而被关进监狱过夜；在巴士底狱被监禁了十年。Incarcerate 是所有这些词中最正式的；虽然意思与 imprison 相近，但它可能暗示最初的监禁行为：他被关在当地监狱等待转移到最高安全监狱。Incarcerated 有时用于暗示在非人道条件下进行的严厉、惩罚性或野蛮的监禁：他们把他关押在一个没有窗户的地下室牢房里。此外，这个词还可以像“confine”一样指将精神病患者关起来；在这里可能强调的是非人道的待遇：这家人把这个可怜的人关在阁楼一个隐蔽的、不通风的房间里。

Intern is unique among this group, in pertaining to the impounding of people or even equipment, as during war: the policy of interning citizens of German origin during World War II. The word, furthermore, contrasts sharply with the punitive possibilities of gaol, imprison and incarcerate, in that the interning can conceivably be done for the internee’s own good: They interned the demonstrators to protect them from the fury of the mob.

拘留是这一群体中独一无二的词，它与扣押人员甚至设备有关，例如在战争期间：二战期间拘留德裔公民的政策。此外，这个词与监禁、监禁和监禁等惩罚性措施形成了鲜明对比，因为拘留可能是为了被拘留者自己的利益：他们拘留示威者是为了保护他们免受暴徒的暴怒。

4.613 Novel
These words refer to extended works of imaginative prose. Novel is the most specific and exact of these words, referring to any lengthy prose narrative that normally has a plot, characters, action and dialogue, but that does not refer to real people or events: best-selling novels; those who consider Don Quixote the first full-length novel. By contrast, fiction is more general since it is the group word for all forms of imaginative prose, including the short story, the novella and the novel. Since the novel is in one sense the most important form of fiction, the group word is often used with a special pertinence to this one form: a poor year for fiction in that no new major novel emerged.

这些词指的是长篇想象性散文作品。小说novel是这些词中最具体、最准确的，指的是任何长篇叙事散文，通常有情节、人物、动作和对话，但不指真实人物或事件：畅销小说；那些认为《堂吉诃德》是第一部长篇小说的人。相比之下，fiction更通用，因为它是所有形式的想象性散文的集合词，包括短篇小说、中篇小说和长篇小说。由于novel在某种意义上是最重要的小说形式，因此这个集合词通常与这种形式特别相关：这是小说的萧条年份，没有出现新的主流小说。

Romance is more difficult to pin down to an exact meaning. A related word in German is equivalent to our word novel, reflecting the development of the novel out of accounts of fabulous or legendary materials in the Middle Ages. In literary discussions, romance is often restricted to works showing works showing this emphasis on the fabulous or legendary, or it may be used more broadly to apply to novels with a strong mythic or allegorical bent: Malory’s gathering together and rewriting of the Arthurian romances; Hawthorne’s novels seen as being essentially romances. Contrary to a popular misconception, the word would never in any literary use refer merely to fiction that concerns itself with love affairs.

romance的确切含义更难确定。德语中有一个相关词，相当于我们的“novel”一词，反映了中世纪小说从神话或传奇材料中发展而来的过程。在文学讨论中，浪漫通常仅限于强调神话或传奇的作品，或者可以更广泛地用于具有强烈神话或寓言倾向的小说：马洛里的收集和重写了亚瑟王的浪漫故事；霍桑的小说被视为本质上是浪漫故事。与普遍的误解相反，这个词在任何文学用法中都不会仅指涉及爱情故事的小说。

While story most commonly is an abbreviated way of referring to an established form, the short story, it is sometimes used loosely and informally for any work of fiction with narrative thrust: novelists who concentrate on telling stories filled with physical violence. The word is also sometimes applied to the plot element of any fiction: a brief paragraph summarizing the story of the novel.

虽然“story”一词最常见的用法是指短篇小说这一既定形式，但有时也被随意地、非正式地用于指任何具有叙事主旨的小说作品：专注于讲述充满暴力故事的小说家。这个词有时也适用于任何小说的情节元素：一个简短的段落，概括小说的故事。
